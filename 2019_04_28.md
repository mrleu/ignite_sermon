## Pastor Fred Mok
- wears pink for easter.
Week after easter feels a bit let down, however it feels like there's a lot of stuff happening.
There are some rhythmns that are no repeated the same thing again, and that's the cross. We live in shadow and affect of the cross.

John 15.
First message that was preached on at ignite.
Evangelical is trained to be good at 1.

John 15 is talking about doing.
You eighter obeying him and loving him and he has loved you
It's about doing.

Legalism is a real thing.
Strong emphasis on performance and merit, however you can't read the bible in that perspective.k

Take a couple seconds to define what the gospel is. it's kind of neat when it changes

Recognize we are recreation of christ, becoming an integral body of chirst. You are a part of a new group of people. How is your definition of Gospel change based on how you know God.

As you approach John, can you approach it as an easterner. John is different from Romans. It's writing for both Jews and Gentiles. He is writing in a different way. Read it as a poetry. Looking mystical language.

Look at how John was carried through.

Read it as an easterner is not to read is as a category. You think of them to be all going together.

Illustration of personal life.

6 weeks ago.

Pastor Mok and wife had a fight. Daughter is harder, because she has learning challenges, and they homeschool the daughter. Wife ended up crying and say she felt alone.

There's a strong defensive reaction in defensiveness from his wife's claim
- Pastor Mok think of him as a good husband.
- Something that he thought that was real came crashing down.
- the moment that he thought he was a good husband was crashing down.

There's a relationship that you experience in your life, it would help to see in this passage. Eastern perspective put all things together.

What's the setting when Jesus talked about the vine and the branches.

It's part of the 14-16. It happens in a vineyard. He is looking at vine and branches as he was speaking.
What is repeated most?
Abide.

Jesus had spend more time with us. All things that have spoken to us are more fruitful.

Pruning means to cut away. there has been a pain in this process.

Word of God to prune you when you get hurt. When you experience pain in jesus is in time when God to prune you.

That was a pruning moment. Consequences of not abiding. If any one does not abide, they get thrown away as branches and withers.

Pruning is individual to a person. IT does it to people too. if you don't do anything with the branches, it will get thrown away. This is hinting at the idea of salvation. If you don't remain to be with Jesus, you won't be with Jesus.

Conservative evangelical believes when you become a christian by baptising.
Something that you choose to do when you trust them.

Make a decision. You stay there. There's proximity and active that you decide to stay. You decide to stay with Jesus.

Intimacy will be you like live with him.

Purpose is to bare fruit. Fruit is not defined. The point is that the branch is connected to the vine. Nohting *happens* until you connect it to the vine.

THey want to evaluate the relationship on what the other person says about you. It's not actualy the criteria for loving a person. the only criteria is to love others as jesus had loved you. Other people aren't engaged in that.

The focus is not about bearing fruit. Jesus didn't say your job is bear fruit. your job is to abide.
Our job is to love people. Jesus's job is to bear fruit. no one can bear fruit until you connected to the vine. We feel like we need to produce the fruit, but Jesus is the one that bears fruit.

Your fruit is always in your connection to the vine. Fruit can be

1. spirit
1. word - salvation
1. character - conversion
1. relationships - love to other people.

It's not jesus's point ot say what the fruit is.

We think it's all about bearing fruit.

Keep Jesus's commandement for Jesus to love.

It wasn't put together for the disciples to know what Jesus is teaching until the end.

Who you are and what you do can not be separated. I have to change who you are, and you're going to do it. when you fail, you come back to the vine. you will rely on the way that have loved you.

evangelism - there's a lot of people that thinks they need to know more about tim keller to talk to the people about Jesus.

You just need to go out there to do wax on and wax off.

Failure is what keeps you in the vine.

Jesus is preparing the biggest failure of their life as they abandon him.

We thought the objection is brining more pepole, but no. it's about we love people as people had loved us.

First initial response -- besides angry -- is to prove that he loves his daughter. Do stuff in front of judy to knows that he knows her.
    - exact opposite of what Jesus is doing.

Jesus is not wedded to opinion to others. He is going to get abused and blamed. no way to get opinion of others.

Your job is not to cater to the other person's opinion. Job is to love her and love the daughter.

Part of hte rason being defensive is because he internalizes disappoitnment. He felt the same way disappointed too. He is not choosing to abide in to do that. Jesus loves in regardless.

Do you believe what jesus ahd done in you. do you rest in jesus's promise as you love your wife.

Five years ago.

Spring break trip
- went to the russian river.
- got a kayak an dgo down river.

THere's no way to fight htis current. he need to fine the current to find a get out spot to get out.
It look a degree of surrender to let the current carry out. The love of God is a very strong current.

We tried to find way to follow him is to not fight the current. surrender your control and let it take you.

It will take you to places where someone will hate you. Jesus experienced it in something he did wrong.

it's what it means to abide. It's not to get people to like you.

Loving people problem is that we don't know hwo to handle transition points. Men area afraid to DTR. they don't want the transition to change. He's afraid of the transition point to become a woman, and talk to her as a woman. he runs from the transition. prayer is that god will trust the transition point.

Somoeone he showed gospel to, but he was intersted but not too engaged. he is afraid the transition of getting rejection. WHne you trust God, will you abide him and trust in God and embrace in a way that the person did not make hte transition.

If you evaluate jesus's decision, judas also didn't take it.

at the end you need ot trust God that he is good.
