## Heart behind Ushering
The goal of this is to present what the ushers do in ignite. The key is to show that there is many parallels between the ignite ushers and youth ushres. We are part of the same church. Also highlight why people(me as an case anectode) wanted to serve in ushership.

1. Why I am ushering?
    - humbling experience
        - connect with others better by serving.
    - welcoming people.
        - i used to be a newcomer.
        - if it's awkward for you, good -- that means you're seeing in the same level as the newcomer.
    - connect people to be plugged in.
        - ushershering is part of the full funnel -- from bringing people from outside to inside, church to cell, cell to serve.
        - this is a crucial part to get people to want to come to church, which later funnels into get them to want to go to cell.
