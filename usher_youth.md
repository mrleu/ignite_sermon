Usher Chat
=======================================

## Purpose:
  The goal of this is to present what the ushers do in ignite. The key is to show that there is many parallels between the ignite ushers and youth ushers. We are part of the same church. Also highlight why people(me as an case anecdote) wanted to serve in usher-ship.
  Purpose of the workshop is as follows:
    1. Provide example for heart behind ushering -- why I became an usher.
    2. Provide some general guidelines of ushering -- what my philosophy on ushers.
    3. Practical Examples for people to learn/do.


## Heart behind Ushering

1. Why I am ushering?
    1. welcoming people.
        - i used to be a newcomer.
        - if it's awkward for you, good -- that means you're seeing in the same level as the newcomer.

    1. humbling experience
        - used to come from a smaller church, and had a sense of dis-believe that I don't want to know everyone because I don't have time to know everyone.
        - connect with others better by serving.
        » Philippians 2:3-4: Don’t be selfish; don’t try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves. Don’t look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too.

    1. Become the first layer that brings people into the church.
        - ushershering is part of the full funnel -- from bringing people from outside to inside, church to cell, cell to serve.
        - this is a crucial part to get people to want to come to church, which later funnels into get them to want to go to cell.
        - you won't be their best friends from a single touch point, but you could help them to feel extremely comfortable in where they're at.


## Behavior
Couple of standards:
  ALEX's Philosophy -- this could all be different by people

1. What I hope to bring in ushership
    1. Create an environment that Ushers enjoys being ushers
      - communal event where they can serve with their brothers and sisters
      - have people bring in their authenticity -- if we fake it how we welcome people, others can tell too.

    2. Be a Connector for the people outside of church
      - People are being seen at the level they would like to be treated.
        » My brothers,[a] show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. 2 For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, 3 and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,” 4 have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
        - treat newcomers the way they want to be treated.
        - don't see them as someone above you and below you. Remember what it was like for you when you came to church for the first time. do it.

    3. Optimization/Automation in  Operation:
      - for people to experience God, it's for people to see what it's like heaven on earth within the church.
        - it is crucial for people to be at the church to experience God, rather than been pulled down from man made errors
        - make sure the operation is clear, clean guidelines on what to do. assignment for serving is clear.
          - Couple of guidelines I got from the usher leads
            - go through the pages.
      - automation.
