Pastor Benjy

Blessed by what God is doing here.
  - partake chinese food with Pastor Jason
  
Insane season
  - 4 nieces and nephews
  - neighbor birthday party, and 2 more to go. Pastor runs out of energy.

John 13
- Talking about serving today. 
- great season moving into the new space
- encourages us to tune into the holy spirit.
  - have to rattle ourselves into it.

Bible - a living and active God.

*This word we have is **alive***

don't let the familarity of the story to gloss over what the holy spirit wants to do.

When you come to somebody's end of life - the things they say have a bit of weight to it.

- They are very significant. 
- Jesus knows Judas is going to betray him. 
- Jesus humbled himself.
  
At the very end, the lowest point of Jesus, HE is going to SERVE others.
- taking the lowest thing a person could do.
- people didn't have closed toe shoes back in the day.
- most people walked bare foot. walking around the poop, or on the poop.

What we do today is nothing to do with the cultural aspect. 

You sit at the floor. 

Definition of the servant.
  - a servant is a person that does duties for others.
  - not about making somone great.
  
When we serve, it's an act of worship. it's work!

The way to go up is to go down.

More humble to give than to receive.

Christmas was way better before when gifts are received.

Story about a monk coming out to do good.

* happiness index is the greatest when serving?? *
  no difference when people are receiving and gaining.

We've been *hard wired* by God to actually serve.

When we do things for something else, it makes you happy.

Whe way up is down.(falling upward)

Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren
- Recommendation by Pastor Benjy
- There are 4 words that is empahsized: It's not about you.

True purpose of life happens when you don't think about yourself.

Pastor Benjy reminds himself of the focus by adding "dummy" to the 4 words: It's not about you, dummy!

There's always this weird obligation, that if you're a really spiritual person, you would be engaged. 

Serving is not about us.

It's not an add on to our regular being. 

It means to be fully embedded in who we are.

How to serve? Find Other people's felt need.

People all over the world's need is to *meet Jesus*, have relationship with him.

If you think about unsaved friend, they are probably not aware that it is their most important need.
  - the trick is to find someone elses's felt need. 
  
WHat is important to them? Find and listen, and find the pain.
  - reminds me of a business class i took.
  - crucial conversation. Influence talk. ugh.
  - oh right i remember it now. this reminds me the art of how to have a small talk lol.

Oreville, California
- drug and addiction was a mess there. government was a mess there.
Lord spoke to the person to change up Oreville.
  - dramatic changes in that plae.
  - try to get everyone that's in the church to go out to engage. 
  - they were to serve for the church. 
  
They said, "Didn't Jesus tell us to do this? We just find the needs for the people to serve."

THe couples -- professional football/basketball player. God used their injuries to work on fitness ministry.

It's now also in surrounding city. THey would do church at the fitness facility.
  - you'd be sharing your life with them as you are a coach there.

Jesus serves the least, and asked us to do the same.

Another Story takes place in Toronto similar to serving the least.

Freedom House - what they did was to serve for the downtown.

Have a voice of city counsyl. They have blessed and envision with the city. It's now a hub for all regular activities.
It puts up free movies as an event.
Church says we are here to serve. 

We have Kingdom of God, the Holy Spirit.

They would hold frosty fest. It's super cold there.

2000 people came. 

over 75k people had came to the festival. it all started with people asking how they can serve.

How to serve?

1. take personal ownership/responsibility for your circle of influence.
  - reminds me of pyramid of responsibilty
1. listen to the Lord.
  - be ready to be deployed at any moment.
  - ironic part is that the gps already exists.
1. Obey
  - don't avoid on God's command.
  - obey him.
  - ask God for healing.
