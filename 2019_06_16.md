# Pastor Marques

- preached for phillipines, and did a great job.

Pastor gets to experience more things in the phillipines.

God looks for your availability.

A lot of opposition that goes against in the spiritual warfare.

Prophesy over the leaders for their future. They keep falling out to become demons in the fall out.
They were seeing it. They were shifting into deliverence of their future leaders.

Elevator gets stuck -- the pastor says there's opposition.
got the 15 kids back from phillipines safely.

try to get 75 people to go to retreats. They got almost a 100 to go to retreats.

He doesn't take on the assignment unless he is *guaranteed to fail* unless Jesus shows up.

He forgot his schedules to speak today. The lord does have a word today.

## Walking with GOD

Noah's story!

Genesis 6, 8, 9

Two big God task that he had for God.

God asked Noah to create ark.
    - he was going to create an ark, because there is only evil in the heart of men.
    - he wanted to destroy the men.

The ark is actually 450 feet long
    - this is 75 years of task!

You have to respond in your spirit yes to God to make it happen.

Millenials we cant do stuff in 75 days.
    - we need to be like Noah

Second tasks, God wants him to repopulate the world with his seed.
    - his three sons, and three wives, and his wife

A big under-taking to take to re-populate the world. God found that he was a just man, and a perfect man.

The last days we are living in, the last day shall be the son of men.

Eating is just feeding yourself. drinking is just insideously.

The reason why God called Noah is because Noah *walked with God*

THe only other person - Enoch walked with God. Enoch did not taste death. If you walk with God, there's more that God wants to do with you.
Who knows we are going to do more beyond.

Walk out your salvation with fear and trembling.

It's never a first step, it's a walk.

In the spirit when you mature the lord, you learn how to move with the lord.

When god says go you go, when god says stop you stop

you gon walk with god.

if you do big things, you need to be in tunes with God.

1. step up
1. step in
1. stepped away
1. step back out

### Stepped up
- used to be at clubs and parties and fights.

Even noah didn't know what it was.

When god told us to do these big tasks, we might have never done this before.

the biggest enemy is the inner-me.
There must be some doubts that is in his life when he needs to start something, and feels stuck to think that you're wasting your time.

This happened to Peter as he wanted to step out of the waves in the middle of the storm
Same thing happened ot Noah, he had stepped up to the challenge.

He is releasing the Noah annointing -- ability to build something. ability to tune to God to have the blueprints.

Pitch is what we used as an atonement.

He wanted us to fix our eyes onto him.

THere are three levels on that ark. Only if we can step out to the 3 levles, we can see the heavenly things of what God wants.
Pastor marques wants to be the 100 fold christian. God is giving us the ability to build.

### Ask God what you are **suppose to build**

- build an *ark*
- a place of safety and refuge and you and others in the spear that you live in

We usually think building a good space is building a church.

only 3% of the people work here. GOd is telling us to build the safety and refuge in teh principle of God in your sphere.

### Seven Mountains of Influence.

Bill bright

Every mountain/culture has a 7 mountains. if you can influence it the 7 mountains, then you can win the people taht are in it.

1. Religion
1. Education
1. Entertainment
1. Business
1. Family
1. Government
1. Media

Internet is the inter "net" - you capture  through media.

Not going to hear profanity to be in the barbers.

He was afraid no one wants to work here, but now they are known as the barbershop are known to be wholesome.

Step in - he could have created, but there's a voice that says to come in.
- fellowship with him

Step away - judgement was 40 days, but they were doing something for hundreds of days. It's the works of God. 7 months the Ark rested at the top. you will see hte flood and judgement for stuff not working. Judgement is for the outside, but you will be elevated.

God's goal is to end up ark of Noah -- to be at the top of the mountain. Season of hibernation -- that's when you know you need to be in the rest.

Step out - they reproduce the land.

God blessed Noah and said be fruitful and multiply. Planned vineyard and getting drunk. Be cautious of how we walk. Sometimes after big victory, we might be running to big defeat. be circumstances to the defeat.

We recognize him as the goodness and the greatness.
