## Speaker: Pastor Belinda
    - founded church 24 years ago.
    - a lot of us are shaped by our parents.
    - Translator is Frances.
        - Pastor Belinda's daughter
        - how two generations come together to work together

There are growth process that we can't let go.
When we grow, we experience a lot of hurt.
    - we can use manasai to ephraim.
OT called Joseph - a kid who is very loved by his father. When he gets loved, his brothers start to hate them.
Father even gave him a beautiful coat. Whenever he wears that coat, all the brothers were all hating him.
    - it shows that he was the one that the father loves the most.
    - he got jealously from brothers.
    - he was also sold to Egypt(slavery + jail house)
    - Joseph has a gift -- he has father and heavenly father's love.
        - he can dream a lot and have a lot of visions.
        - he then get favoritism
        - Joseph has the presence of God with him.
    - Pharaoah gave Joseph a wife. first kid is named manasay
        - meaning of the word: God has made me forget all my hardship
    - Second son name is Ephraim
        - meaning is God makes me fruitful at the land of infliction

We may have gone through a lot of suffer.

Pastor Belinda is 15 years apart from brother.
- her little sister is very smart.
- it feels like the family really think the sister is smart
- when it came to PB, they think PB was more dumb
    - she never thought that she was smart
    - she used to think dumb == pure

When someone says that she is pure, she feels like people were saying that she is dumb.

When she dated pastor tong, they said PB looks innocent/pure.
    - that's when she felt like they said she is dumb

She used to not have confidence in herself. She has two daughter -- Frances and Tiffany.
She always wishes the two daughters to be different than her.

Big daughter likes to read books.
Small daughter is very different.
    - she doesn't seem like a good kid by the way that she performs
    - stuff she likes is stuff that PB doesn't like.
        - doesn't like the music(rap music)
        - not like her friends.
        - daughter that has friend that is grafitti artist
            - they go out and vendalized together

She felt very nervous. One time she was driving, the daughter said all her friends hate PB.
She felt like she was the driver for all the circumstances -- she does not know why.

That's because it's on her face when she does not like them.
She went repenting to God, that's when her thoughts and feelings were on her face.

When she couldn't accept her daughter friends, that means it's a hurt to God.

She then asks God for forgiveness to redeem herself.

On her daughter brithday, the duaghter said to invite her frineds to come over.
PB did a great feast for her friends to eat. Chinese people when there's party, there's an adult table and kids table.

PB loves to cook -- that meal redeem herself. They at this point still remember what she cooked.
because they are pastors, so when they do stuff  -- they wish their kids can make them shine
Don't want their kdis to be an embarrasement for them. So they were really strict with the daughter.

When they go pray for people, they told them to not to talk. She wnats people to think they have good image. Their duaghter had some huge pressure.
She was shocked that a lot of people are seeing how Pastor Belinda + Frances' performance.

She often felt the stress given to the children. Ministry gets very busy. Often times the work also takes a lot of time. Most of the time as parents, it's hard to keep the promises.
They most of the time they couldn't take their kids out -- so they disappoint the children.

Jr high/high school, everyday the school ended at 3. She forgets time when she prayed for people. Many times she was late 30-60 minutes.
Younger daughter would wait 30-40 min -- but it still happened.

One time the daughter said "mom, we are also important." She said "lord, please have mercy". Unintentionally would hurt the children.

After PB prayed for her, she told the mom to give daugther a hug. Mother said she was unable, because her husband mom wanted her to have a son -- but she had a daughter. there's a lot of fear and anxiety. So she never held/hug her daughter. She had 4 daughters.

Non of the 4 daughters were held by her. That's when she realizes her hurt came from her family above. A lot of hurts are coming from family. We also like to do compare among the kids.

There will be this favoritism. Grandpa woudl particularly like the one that looks like them. Both kids look like pastor liu family. Mother in law is very happy. Tiffany looks like her dad. So dad is very happy.

Bad family parents relationship, the kids just want to make the mom happy. Whenever mom looks like kid, reminds her of the hatred husband.
There is alwys a feeliing like to please others.

When she knew God, she learned to love.

In all our lives, we all have stuff that our own family carried over the hurts. WHen we want to forget, it's not that easy.
If we're not able to know the God taht created us
    - time only let our hurts to be our stronghold

ONly when we are able to see ourselves stregenth and character.

That's when we can realized that God can heal the hurts that we have.

Because of God's favortism, he feels all the pain -- when he was risen and ranked.
Pharoah would not realize what God has in his life.

Joseph because he knows God

When he first re-united with his brohters -- when they realized who the brother was -- they were scared to interact with Joseph.
Joseph said "dont be hard on yorself because you sold me into slavery. This is God's plan. It is to protect the life of our entire family destiny. It is to save our household so it does not die"

Ephraim - God takes the place he struggels to be fruitful. Genesis 41:51-52

Suffer in God's hands can turn into blessing.

Still so much to come and share. Please do come and remmeber that when we come together to the lord, God will give us the opportunity to see and to view our own character.

When we don't have confidence, we will find taht we can fogvie.

Joseph cried when the brotheres asked for forgiveness. He said he will take care of the next generations.

Parents have a lot of pressures and expectations to the children. After many years, when they reflect, they felt like they have stuff that they did not do right.

However they don't know how to fix it. They don't know how to express that. She wants to ask the kids to say to forgive the parents. Fogives the parents that they have hurt the kids
Pray that God woudl work in us to fix the relationships that they have
