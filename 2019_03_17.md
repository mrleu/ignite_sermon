## Today's Speaker: Jason Wang

Recap of a month ago -- prodical son -- please reference `2019_02_17.md`
    Parallels to our christian walk.
    Reflect on Pastor Jason's personal testimony

Matthew 20:1-16
- the vinyard and the dineros. This is the continuation of the prodical son. The one about where two people both got the same reward, but paty their wages although work disproportionally.

For the kingdom of heaven is like """"
- dinarius is the typical wage of a day's labor.
- divded to 6 hour wages

Taking it into the modern day context?
Use the salary the hours and times by day of hours.

For a human perspective, it doesn't make sense.
- learning how to reread it again.
- can't remove just because it does not make sense.
- people that started first got a bad deal.

### Characteristic about the early workers.
1. Agreed to work for a denarius
- Master didn't cheat them in anything.
- It was an agreed upon the amount.
- Not cheated, or swindled.
- What was agreed upon. They were probably happy about it.

However, they were expected to pay *more* after seeing what people go paid. Then afterwards, they started to grumbles on the pay that got paid in comparison to others.

Grumbling - it's only started after seeing other people.

Reminds ZPJ the prodical son, that made him feel like it was not right.

Old son had the work based/merit based mentality.

Kingdom of heaven is not a merit based theology. It's different form our world view, and contradicts the way that the world is made.

You need to **unlearn** for the things you have learned.
     - very much counter-intuitive.
     - we've never imagined ourselves as the villain. 

People tend to identify themselves as heroes.

Another example at work.

Most people are happy when they are first at the job. Then the annual review pops up, there's these compensation/merit increase. When you hear the other people's compensation, that's when you have weird feelings about work. 
    - yah..not really hat that before, maybe it's because i don't really ask people their pay?
    - there's definitely a portion of the comparision rather than actual raw metric.

Payroll can't look into envy and jealousy.
    - the ones that irked jasonn is where the person that next to him is getting paid. Nothing in ZPJ's own job has changed.
    - The worst is when someone had higher pay, and they are younger than ZPJ.

ZPJ feels like it was eating himself away. A lot of time we get unahppy what we have when we compare ourselves with other people. This includes ministry, results, praise, and even the personal life as well.

ZPJ feels worse when there's someone that is more fit than others. We start to get unhappy with what we have.

##  **Don't compare yourself in blessing.**

Wise quote zpj had heard - stephen curry, since he get under paid. Never paid other people's money.

Only thing was someone else's life that made him feel irked and uncomfortable.

**Master**
He does what is right. He was helping people who needed help. He gave jobs to people who had been idled all day. This reminds me of the story where pastor david kim talked about paying wages for the people that wash cars.

Mastor still calls the people friend, and he also had said he did to the people no wrong. Master didn't take it personally, and still calls them friend.

Still call them friend after been antagonized.

Dinarius belongs to the master -- the master gets to choose what is belonged to the mastor.

All these stuff belongs to the master.

 `Last will be first, and the first last.`

Younger ones don't stay small together, younger one gets to taller and stronger?

#### Treat everyone nicely

ZPJ don't know everyone's background, but he gives everyone the same respect.

Characteristic of God.

God does what is right.

He helps people who need help.

God promotes whoever he chooses to promote. THese are the characteristic of God.

How do they relate? God shows him this passge when he had the older son mentality.

People in church didn't get the opportunity to have when he/she didn't do much about it. He thought he had the right to be angry. He feels like he was losing holy status.

ZPJ used to be able to do everything as assistant pastor. Baptism, new youth assistant helped out the baptism. ZPJ was thinking that he never baptized a person before, He then knew something was wrong with him. This is the plug for baptism :w

sense of right and wrong, where does it come from? does it come from God? It totally destroyed zpj on what is right and wrong. If he decides what is right or wrong, he needs to follow what God defines as.

God also said it's not fair that **Jesus Christ dying on the cross is not fair** Being able to complain to God is also not fair, it's because Jesus Christ had died on the cross.

ZPJ now feels like he needs to change. It's because jesus christ had paid for all of us -- when we didn't even know him.

God asks us to give the same grace, the same mercy. That's when ZPJ starst to have more of a fatherly heart. With less of the moral compass.

ZPJ does feel like more people, more ministry, more volunteers.

ZPJ is saying it in faith.

Consider yourself the sense of right and wrong. Is it coming from our own upbringing? or is coming from the lord.

Maybe you won't grumble in front of zpj, but you might grumble in front of the echo chamber. It's ok to voice your concern.

There's a difference between grumble or concern. He gave up his notion on getting to serve is based on the tenure. Sometimes is doesn't matter how long you're at a certain place. Tenure is not th most important metric. SOmething that zpj had struggled before.
