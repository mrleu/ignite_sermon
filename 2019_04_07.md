Did some ushering and missed osmething

Habakkuhhk 2:1-4.

He said soemthing about regretting marrying too early.

Is Habbakuk like my thing, or other people's thing?

Good thing or a God thing?

The way you discern if it's God's thing or not is if the burninng Heart(God's will) stay in your heart.

The more you think about it, the more it burns brighter. THe thing that you love comes and go. Things you want quickly shifts from one to another. A Good thing may not be for you, however a God's thing is something that you can't get it out of your system.

It doesn't disappear, and it burns brighter and brighter. The dream that God put into your heart doesn't go until the end. If it stays in you for a long time, it doesn't go away.

God is telling you that thing that you may ignored(and have not made actions towards), it made be yours.

We grabbed God's will before it comes to us

Nina and David Kim are too patient in getting married. They rushed it. Look at your past pattern. are you more impatient, they are impatient people.

The culture is accustomed to go faster and faster, but it's not the currency of God. The passivity is also stopping you from it.

When it comes, you passed it by and missing it because of insecurity and/or fear.

Pastor David Kim likes to have it his way. He always pull it in his time. Look at impatient group and the passive group.

Important to recognize everything. Contexual matters...? shake my head.

The righteous show by living by faith. Look at the past pattern of your heart posture. Sometimes when we go back and forth we miss the opportunity for God to give us in our lives.

How do you know if you are in it or now? God's will stays and his timing flows. He has to force his way in. Sometimes when he forced it, it's not God's timing yet.

What is flow? when you do it, it is natural and easy. The joy and affirmation of God would just come through easily with no trial and tribulation. It is as if when you pushed it, the timing just flows.
It does not feel like you're trying too hard. The blessing is just going as flow.

God is moving, and the feeling just feels *smooth*

God gave pastor david heart to lead a church.

## Pastor David's testimony
God continues to let it grow. he did try to force to plant a church.
- tried launching someting, but it didn't really worked.
- until he continues to work in his impatient and pride, he can't get to the right of way.

Why is God delaying his will, *if you are frustrated by the slowness of God, it means God wants to work through the heart posture with you*

God would want to work at your passivity, so you would trust him more in his power.

It's not about me, and what i do, but it's about your will. This is where you navigate the place, and God is moving in your heart posture.


## Another story
Pastor David really didn't like 6 people at the church. They began to hurt him and his family. He feels like he was close to leaving the church as he was praying. This praying of GOd's timing.

pastor david said God wants him to love the 6 people before he is able to leave. for 6 long months, God was doing it in him. One of the person is pastor david' boss.

Heart posture is something that God does. THe love for the leader all of sudden flow into him.
