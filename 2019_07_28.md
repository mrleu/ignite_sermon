# Ignite Ministry 7/28
## Speaker: ZPJ

## who's the GOAT
we get interested in life significance. we talked about in football/basketball who is the GOAT(greatest of all time)

When you read the bible, you see the disciples as very holy people.
    - however, there's a story in Bible where they argue who is the GOAT.
    - mentioned in all matthew, mark, and luk
        - important to talk about the story given that the disciples were arguing about it.

Mark 9:33-37.

Sports people would have data points to make the claim.

Jesus usually teaches when he sat down.
    - it's interesting because Jesus knew what they were talking about.
    - decides to talk to them in private.
    - anyones who is the first must be the last to serve for them all.

_Jesus usually turn all things around_

Somtimes at church we define our greatness by statistics(Closer to senior pastor, people that come to church, people that gets healed)

If you want to be the greatest, you need to be the servant for all.
    - Jesus changes our paradigmn

Jesus's mentioning of _children_
    - picks children as an example for us to serve,
    - most helpeless and dependenless person.
    - cell group have up to 5 babies.
        - they are very helpeless and dependents on the children

Jesus said if you want to be the best, you have to welcome the children.
Even if they can't give you anything back, you need to serve for them.
Children also don't give you recognition.
If you are serving because you want to be recognized, you acutally defeat the purpose of the kingdom principles.

Matthew 6 -- be careful not to practice your righteousness
    - no reward from your father

Pharisees give infront of people. They also praise in front of people, and fast in front of people.

zpj didn't know that she serves in children ministry(KATIE)
    - they're getting their reward in heaven.

humblebrag -- weird flex but ok. 

Matthew 5:16
Let your light shines before others, so they may see your good deeds and gloriy your father in heaven.

How do i know who to serve?
- there are more ways to serve than before.

analysis paralysis -- too many choices confuse people.

You start to overthink and over-analyze.

When ZPJ thinks of what to do, he thinks of ACTS

King David serves for his gen and died.

When ZPJ starts to think about the future, he gets pessmistics

David serves God's purpose, so you should think about your purpose too.

For Jason
God First, 
Family 2nd,
Work/Church 3rd.

ZPJ usually pray for himself, and trust through hiim also praying for others.
    - he would get overwhlemed with 100 people of thoughts.

ZPJ's Brother came over at 11:30 PM
He feels like he is speaking more naturally.

Sometimes it's the people just happen naturally.

Example of ultimate leadership

John 13:14-17

Don't think too much with the other stuff.

If we trust in the Lord, God will provide in our shortcomings

Jesus washes his disciples' feet.

We are all called to serve on another

ZPJ washed homeless people's feet in SF.
- it's tough and humbling.

When people serve you, it's a lot of a humbling experience.

People think more highly when they were serving others.

DO you think more highly or lowly when you grow older to see your parents.

### Personal Story for ZPJ's mother:

Jesus loves us so much that he died for us even when we are sinners
