## Pastor - Jason Betler
  - came in a bit late due to usher duty :(

don't forget where the source is.
  - when you lose job, it's losing resouce. not source.

whenever you see a sequence of words in scripture
  - you might not get it at first, but take note of it.
  - they are all put in order for a reason.
  - the sick, the blind..

when you're sick, you lose your stregenth.
  - the longer you're sick, you start to lose your vision.
  - it's where the sequential of blind coming in.
  - paralyze because you lost your confidence.
  - when jesus asked if you want to get well, it's an obvious question to the sick.

When jesus said do you want to get well
  - he is asking what do you **really really want**
  - the man answered "Sir". it's amazing that he didn't really know who Jesus is.

Story time from Pastor Jason
  - sometimes when you want things to happen, and you just can't make it happen.
  - you need to come to God in your prayer, because you wouldn't know want you really really want unless you pray to God.
  - when you come to your prayer, it's like bringing your garbage to God.
  - sharing all your struggles to God.
  
Society thinks you're just tearing yourself down, but pastor Betler thinks this is the time that you're honest with God.
  - your stregenth is not enough, and you would need to find your confidence in God.
  - give God your excuses, he is big enough of a God to receive it all.
  - if you don't verbalize it, then you will not be able to figure out how to move foward.
  - American Society is big in strengths.
  - whole society comes from the strength.

But when you're sick, your vision is affected.
  - you then wait for anybody to come to help you.
 
WHen you built on the stregnth that you think you have. when it goes away, there's nothing left.

On the other side, when Jesus asks what you really want.

Let's talk about what you really want.

Pastor Jason Betler has a cluttered desk. A lot of stuff. He said he would just throw all his mess away, and just sit down to ask God what HE really really want.

God doesn't build on your strength. In the kingdom of God it's always opposite. You are rooted in your identity in God.
  - you then feel motivated, because you start having hope.
  - if you build on Jesus, he will build it to you.
 
What's possible to God? Anything HE wants.

**Nobody** can tackle you down, because your confidence is in Christ.

In our weakenss, he is **strong**

Those who are realy confident with themsevles crumble when they are sick. if you rooted in christ, then you don't crumble. You go to office to change the temperature. You belong here.
Your stregnth is determiend on what God has said about you. It may look the same on the surface, but completely different on the inside.

I'd rather you be hot or cold then lukworm.

Why's that the case? If you are in room temperature, you're not making any difference. You are determining what the temperature is going to be. Your confidence is not what coworker think of you. Your words have certain weight because you are not tied to others' opinion.

Behind it is a design that God wants all things to be made well.


They key is to uncover what God wants you to do.
  - God wants you to heal.
  - question God is asking is what is missing. The therapeautic portion is to understand what is missing.
  - God wants to heal you.
  - pastor betler talked to many people, they seem to all be brought down to what they went through in the past.
  - be honest with God.
  - that's where you'll find the release and the freedom.
  - as your soul prosper, your body will prosper.
  - next time when you have a prayer of God, don't just turn on the netflix.
    - give God the opportunity.
    - you're missing it if you youtube for more than 3 hours a day.
    
Amazong how many people are wasting their time using the mobile device. It is also killing our spiritual life.

You gotta make yourself do it. You can't live through other soap operas.

We build around our lives in what we see. those things will not satisfy us.

Provers 13:12

Have an honest conversation with God.

You can't father with out Jesus.
  - certain things you can't do on your own.
    - if your confidence is in him, he will build you up.
