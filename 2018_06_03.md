Be Responsible attitude

1. Remove the hindrance for unity
  1. Inrresponsible Attitude
    - adam and eve as example.
      - Genesis 3:12-13
      - blaming games start with the men.
      - it's becaues the men has hte responsibility.

      1. Mature person will take responsibility
      One thing we can do is to take the responsibilty to ourselves
  1. Selfish Ambition
    - focus on career and self ambition!
    - he was robbing from the poor - no friends.
      - when Jesus was passing by, zakkesus(?) wanted to see Jesus!
      - he has no **friends**
      - changed his life from the inside out.
      - Luke 19:8
        - zacchaeus said -- here i give half of my possession to the poor.
        - the one who is greedy is now giving to the poor!
        - this is unheard of!
        - God has turned zacchaeus to be a giving person!
          - a generous person
  1. Self righteous
    - he thinks he is alwasy the best! the best way!
    - Warriors are awesome because they are team players!
    - no one is superb within the team. 
    - everyone is good!!
    - ** We need to have that attitude**
      - no one should have an idea on who has the best way.
    - Phil 4:1-2
      - let lord be the center of the relationship.
      - he hasks to plead with one another to agree with each other in the Lord.
  Story time: Pastor Hingchai and Tong are very different. They don't always push on their ways because they want to unify on their common mission to build the great church for the Lord. We need to learn to take the selfishless away.
    - the root of selfishness comes from **Pride**!!
      - you think you're hte best, you think for yourself. 
      - How can we cultivate unity?

1. Culture the attitude for unity: gentle and humble!!
  - Jesus is the son of God! He humbled himself, and crucified on the cross. 
  - what really helped Jesus to go through with this humbleness? it's not easy to humble himself as a man and as a servant.
  - Mathews 11:29. _For I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will rest for your soul_
  - we need to have the same attitude as Jesus Christ. His attitude was gentle and humble. Not always the first one to receive credit.
  - Phil 2:5-8 is pastor hingchai's favorite book of the phil.
    - not one time Jesus uses his position to demand service to anyone.
    - **he was so humble!!**
    - "became obedient to death -- death on a cross"
    - God the father has the master plan, holy spirit is leading it, but who is doing the job? *Jesus Christ the **SON OF GOD.***
    - in any of our relationships, the attitude will go a long long way.
  - how to do it?
    - appreciate and discover other people's strength!
      - we were easy to judge others.
    - Phil 2:3. Do things in humanity by considering others better than ourselves.
    - Example: when Saul became Paul! on the way to damascas, Saul become a believer. He was going to go back to the jerusalem and let them know. People were still afraid of him when he returned to the church of Jerusalem. At this time Barnabus is already filled with Holy Spirit. He brings Paul in, and introduce Paul to the apostles. With the recommendation, Paul begans to preach for the gospel. Antioch have many believers in jesus christ. Now they have this challenges. Who should be teaching? Let's invite Paul!
    - because Barnabus affirm the teaching of Paul, so he brought him in a year to teach them about God. This is why we are called Christian, because of his teaching. *We need more Barnabus!!*
    - Application: create opportunity for others to discover their gifts!!
1. We need to look into the interest of others.
  - Paul tells us not to look at ourselves, look into others.
  - Phil2:4! Look not only in our own interest
    - applauding for our cell leaders
      - they think about the interst of others. 
      - cell leader was hurt when she got badly named. 
        - after she had kid, tries to run away from cell group leader
        - husband says yes.
    - we are united together for God's glory to build God's glorious Church.
