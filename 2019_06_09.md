# Ignite Sermon

June 28-29 Rolcc Revival Conference

## ZPJ

## Parable of the new wine and the old wineskin

Luke 5:33-39.

### Jesus forgives and heals paralyzed man
    1. Luke 4 17-36
- opposition from Pharisees to see what Jesus is doing.

### Jesus Calls Levi and Eats with the Sinners

- pharisees complained about Jesus eating with tax collectors + etcs.

### Jesus Questioned About Fasting

### Jesus is the Lord of the sabbath
- son of men is the lord of the sabbath

Luke specifically put this story together with opposition. New wine to new wine skin specifically in the middle of the message.
Pharisee is opposing to Jesus, because Jesus was doing what was not allowed in the ritual back in the day.

New wine tells us about the opposition.

*Luke 5:33-39.*

purpose of fasting is to get **Closer** to God.

God is already here in the form of Jesus. No place to fast, as Jesus was with them. Pharisee thinks of the same thing, but they are so caught up to the thing that they have missed the moment. They have missed that Jesus is here already. They even compared them with John's disciples.

Pharisee did not get it, because they're caught up with the old way they were thinking. Pharisee had *lost sight of the purpose*

Modern day, it's like parents and kids. every parents want to provide better life for their kids. For the sake of doing that, they will work extremeley hard for them to have better lives. however, they would work so hard that they're barely home. Working too hard makes the opposite happens. Childhood is not so great because parents relationship with the children were missing.

School - going to school is to learn. A means you've learned it well. We often focused on getting the good grade, and forget about the learning. Grade suppose to be the reflection of learning.

Work - great contribution to company/scociety. We get promoted and higher salary in exchange. When we just cared about getting promoted, and the original purpose to bring value to the society is missing.

Church - might lose sight of church. Going on a habit to be closer to God, but in reality we have lost the purpose of what church is.

new garment will shrink when you wash it. what you wanted to fix, ended up making it worst.

new wine in old wine skin it would expand. old wine skin can't expand anymore, it may also burst the old wine skin. New wine expands -> new wine skin expands.

*new things in old structure makes things worse.*

Pharisee can't see it because they see it in the old covenant.

Jesus has brougth new covenant -- repentance and have relationship with God.

New covenant is the new wine, new tradition -- yet it's hard for the pharisees to understand.

In return they were upset with the changes.

#### Examples

Computers are easy for younger generation, but harder for previous generation.

Hard for them to know what Jesus is doing.

Even though God is the same, but his method is always changing.

We need new structures to fit into the new things God wants us to do.

30 years ago, multi-service churches were not possible. How we've purchased materials also don't work anymore. Most of us now buy stuff online.

Instead of saying "no", he starts to say "wow" and "how"

Some people may never change, and he would encourage us to not to be that person.

Things are always changing. God gets presesnted differently. Things are always changing. Pharisee never changed. They were so mad at Jesus, that they decided to crucify him.

They've decided that the old way is better.

### How does it relate to ignite.

- continuation from find your purpose sermon.

The purpose of ignite will partly impact your life. Impacts more the more you're involved. ZPJ is responsible in leading this group.

He will look at the purpose of Ignite.

- Part of ROLCC
- largest and influential chinese church outside of asia.
- next generation of this church
- english speaking version of this church

If you look at the place for boba, it's your group.

Place for **BOBA** -- might be hard place for coffee.

Ignite is also a gas station.
Rarely people were called to work for a gas station. They all come here to get refueled, rested, trained, and takes their place to be salt and light of the world.

It's a place to help people prepare for that mission. It's not that we can just keep it here, but we can influence this society.

hopefully you empower the world that makes you want to make a difference.

it's not meant to be capped here.

This place is to be equipped to go out there to make a difference.

Vegetation and life flows as the river flows.

Things do get kind of weird when it stopped flowing.

WHen new people come, zpj would also need to grow further as well. God is doing new things in ignite.

new people == new things.
