## Speaker - Pastor ZPJ
been awhile since he has been preaching.

since growing up this beard, zpj feels wiser.
- speak slower, deeper.
- less pressure to speak in high pitch.

learn to accpet himself, hopefully we can accept ourselves.

NEPAL - spiritual pilgrimage.
- spiritual growth.

Himalayas - coming back from the mountain top becomes a different person.

NEPAL - hardest physical trip.
- strips you to the bare bones.

illegal to evangelize.
people have to be able to check out christianity themselves

short term relationship is to build friendship.
- build interest.

long term relationship people can actually do the long process for them to accept gospel.

remote village called sikmas
- only 1k people.

people invite you to home to drink tea.
- small huts.

we have more bathrooms than people.

lots of livestock walking with them.

hindu/buddhist monastary there.

there is no church there. it feels like a unreached people group. It was 1.5 days of travel to get there.
33 hours of pure travel to get to the 1k people.

living accomodation is very hard to imagine.
eat same food there. leeches all over the place.

can't believe how god created leeches.

its just how life is like it out there.

long term appreciation for longer term missionary.

keeps going to the village all over again. much greater appreciation for long term missionaries.

sunday - they had mini ignite service. preached about what he shared in that group.

Luke 4:14-30

teaching at the synogoague
- people liked what he was teaching.
- ideah of messaiah is in the king david descendent

disciples cared about being the greatest.
- think about this is the greatest kingdom that was established.

Jesus was there to establish a different kind of kingdom

they weren't angry that he claimed to be the messaiah

after he shared the leprasy that people start to get upset.

### what makes people so furious?

they were so furious that they wanted to kill them.

What did jesus said that was so offended.

Elijah and Elisha were prophets from couple hundred years ago. Used by God. THese prophet of God are used not to Israelites.

God used prohpets to help non-israelites.

1 king/ 2 king have rebuke to Israels.

Messiah for all people. kingdom is for all people. meant to establis a new kingdom.

not only jesus diss the audience, but he said he is also there for the enemies too.

### How to bring this to modern context?
parables of light applying to ignite.

people take the expectation at mason, but mason didn't deliver.

THere are many ways to look at the passage.

1. Rejection of the prophet in your own hometown.
1. The Gospel is always for all people.

THe reason why isarelites are so mad is because they are spiritual blind to Jesus.
    They have their own assumption on how Jesus should work.

Spiritual Blindness is not seeing things that God should have seen things.

Dark Knight Reference: nobody panicks when peeople follow the crazy plan.
when no one follows the plan, everyone loses their mind.

when things don't go according to plan, people panick.

### Are we being intentional to see how god sees things.
how many times in mark 10 it said jesus physically heal blind. it's also spirtually implied the blind.

pharaseee did not know they were spiritually blind.

### What has ZPJ being spiritual blind to?

2/6 people that shared has shared about the lost of their father.

When we lose something we loved, we're mostly spiritually blind.

Father left his family and took everything.
    - doesn't know why he left.
    - local tourguides.
    - mom is christian, but too poor to raie.
    - sent him to orphanage.
    - became tourguide for truckers.
        - wanted to be a missiionary instead.
        - short term hosting, but he loeves what he is doing.

Never thought he needed a father. But he realized he always had a father that loved him.

doesn't now how to relate to his story, just listen.
    - orphanage gave him great education.
now he has a better life because of it.

God works in _Mysterious way_

God is still watching all over him.

### Second story.
- lost father to cancer.
- father believed he'd completely heal from the cancer.
- before he died, he was able to muster a smile on his face.
- never seen enough stregnth to muster a smile.
- father received a diffrent type of healing that day. now he is in father.
- honor his father to go to mongolia.

received complete healing in things they didn't expect.
