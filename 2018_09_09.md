YWAM. Youth With A Mission

a bit nervous, cuz he didn't see anyone 75. 

 keep it real guys.
 
 quoting john14:6
 the truth is not cognitive truth.
   cognitive truth is what we learned in school.
truth means reality. what is **right**
- also means being **real**

Jesus is saying he is the real deal, not fake.

- had history where people pretend they go to church.

Jesus invented a bad word?

*hypocrite* is not a bad word until Jesus invented it.
- used to mean _actor_
- not in relationship w/ the God almighty.

Being with YWAM for 51 years now.
- dealing with them since he was 18-20.

Statistics of youth:
- how many people when they leave home when used to raised christian stopped going to church. Stop believing in God.
- there's more than it should be.

Main reason people leave the christian faith is because of hypocrite.
- "What my parents are like at church is not what they are like at home."
- "Pastor leader is good at teaching the bible, but there's a hidden life."

Causes **lots of** people to drop out.

Jesus talks intentionally in hypocricy.
- what you see is what you get.
- Jesus was *real*

Living a vitorious christian life is not about learning about thousand of bible verses, or being in a long span with Jesus Christ.

Manifesting Jesus in real life is to **LOVE**
- The World already knows of the Christian religion, and they don't like it.
- most had been killed.

Recently being streaming with Thailand Conference. One day they couldn't stream it, beacuse the people that were shared were from very dangerous for Christians place. Can not be named, because Christians had been systematically killed.
- Whole family were burned alive because they were Christians.

A lot of them knows us, and just don't care or they are hostile.

Millions of people wants us to be dead because we're christians.

Calling us to Stop calling our religion is better than other religion.

We don't want people to belong in a particular reglion called Christian.

It's all about *relationship with God*

Big deal here is **eternal life**

We are all going to die one day.

Is it matter if we have 3000, presence of God in our meetings, correct doctrine?

Only thing that matters billion years from now.

If we were to have billion years in eternal life, what's going to matter?

*How many people made it.*

How many people pass from death to life due to the cross of Jesus Christ.

It's a *simple religion*

Best known bible verse: John 3:16

God's response to our screw up is
- it's about what God is doing during our worship.

Worship is channel where the spirit of God is doing *stuff*
- Important to have Worship leader is sensitive what God is up to in the room.
- worship is a processing time with the almighty God.
- if we just follow the sequential of the song list, we don't really know the meaning of *worship*

God never talks to people who don't come. He is very practical. Only talks to the people who come.

Almost every day, people said "it's exactly what i needed to hear."

it's all about how much God *loves you*.

## It's about Loving Guys!

1 John 4.

Eldest son. the beloved. It talks about inheritance. All in christ is the eldest son. We receive the inheritance when the elder son died. The elder son died, so we ininherited everything.

Even if you don't know about your family background, God replaces the inheritance.

We get everything God is, and everything God has become ours.

We are *heirs of God*. Joined heirs with Jesus Christ, of the richest ,most perfect, wisest, being in the universe. 

Jesus Christ is not just hte Lord of Lord and King of Kings, but he is also your elder brother(coming from Hebrews 2.)
  - what happened to us when we accepted Jesus.
  - we become the brother of Jesus Christ. BOOM.
 
 Having the same brother.
 
Jesus asked us to pray in "OUR FATHER"
- he's including you.
- God is my father, and as much as he is the father of Jesus's. 

Bride is a picture of acceptance?
 
Used to live in Australia, and married there.

Still remembers the bride coming in 47 years ago. All he could think of is why shes is walking slow. When she's there, he's waiting for how long the meeting is.

Was at a wedding practice with his daughter, and he was walking his daughter down the isle.

- she calls him to shut up, because she had had the plan since 6 years old.

A bride is a picture of acceptance. It's very acceptable to bride grooms.

First event happened when Jesus comes back is having the marriage supper.
Bride of Jesus Christ is a big deal.

Jesus is as excited for you as in love with you and as excited to having relationship with you as to bride and groom.

Jesus is in love with us.

No way jesus will do anything to hurt us.
- he is **perfect**
- he is **sin-less**
- not even possible for him to mess up.

That's the person you're engaged to

Satan has never produced Love.

Some people have love mixed with selfishness, but they are really in love.
- we have this capacity and ability to love because we are made in his image.
- even non-christian has ability to love.

Non-Christians are also made in God's image.
Love is a God thing.
Love is something that God passed on when he breathed into someone.

### Humanity is not bad.

Never going to be anything not a human. 
it's because Jesus was a human, and we were made image of God.

The World knows about Christianity, and what they need to see is **Jesus**
- doorway fo them seeing Jesus is loving them.
- we got to out love other people.

Christianity already have hateful/selfish/controlling things.

## Be someone reflecting of God.

A lot of people pray for Revival. 

## All men know that you're followers of God if you love.

That's why we are here @ church.
To let as many as people to believe, and give in this eternal of life.

- let as many people to have eternal life.

Let all men everywhere to be saved. 1 Timothy.

What is going to guarantee most people to be saved? **LOVE**

Message is that you have to out love the humanist. You have to out-loved all other religion. We have got to be known. Don't repeat generations. Not just practice religion. We have got to demonstrate God's heart. God's heart in response is to love..

We got one thing that we need to do. Way more important than anything else. Love people.
Quick to forgive. Show mercy. More important to be loved than to be right. Love is the principle thing. God has not every/will never do something that's not loving.

Godly means God like. What is holiness: acting like God.

How can you and I to be more like God? By loving more.

I am in Christ.

How can you be closer than being in Christ? You have to *love more*

Manifesting and yielding to what we already had.

Acting more like God on a daily basis.

### How do we do this? Is it even possible?

Did God anticipate our generation?

Love is universal and outside of time. Will work in your time and out of your circumstances.

We know and believe what God has for us.

We *love* because he first love us. God is pouring his love in us.

Justified by faith and peace with God.

We can love. This society just needs huge amount of embrace/acceptance/love people.

I will love. I can love, because i've been lvoed.
