# First Love

Pastor James

How we feel about God in first love. 
We believed in everything that God/MC/preacher had to say.
We wdared to dream with Jesus Together.

We take only the Sunday for the Lord. We know that is not going to work -- which we longed for the first love back.

There are several things that are exercise of Love. THings that we can do to rekindle that love. How we can go further.

3 things to do.

## 1. Solitude.

Availability Check.

- It means being alone by choice.
- Things need to be taken to take solitude from us to spend time with family.
- until the end of the trip, the family got closer, which they get closer.

- Always want to spend quality time with significant other. How to schedule time.
- One resolution is to write out date for Pastor james's wife.

Another meaning of solitude is called the *time of wilderness*
- God gives some wilderness in our lives.
- no one does it by choice.
- it's never easy place to go.

Jesus also goes to wilderness by the holy spirit. Some people entered with out choice. God can make that a good place for you. God can make it the most important place in your life. God would really show how small/weak/limited that you are. It's only when you're really weak, that's where you'll experience God. Then your life is changed.

Some of us are in a form of wilderness. However, God knows where we are off to, and it'll take time.

Instead of licking our own would, start talking with God. Solitude is the best time to know God, and experience him. Joshua -- the successor of Moses!

Joshua also went through much of the wilderness with Moses. He was entered by force. He then voluntarily signed up for moment of Solitude.

Exodus 33:11.

Out of the million of Isarelites, only Moses and Joshua entered the tent of Tabernacle. Joshua was there when Moses received the 10 commandments.  

After the churech service is over, Joshua stilled stayed for the moment of solitude. He really **wants** to be with the lord.

Everything is exciting when serving the Lord. Out of duty ministry with God.

Retreat -- the morning before the devotion is what Pastor James enjoyed solitude with GOd.

It's a way to rekindle your relationship with GOd.

If you feel ilke you have an important relationship to do.

## 2. Sacrifice(Attitude CHeck.)

Major concept of our faith! 

When Adam and Eve were casted out, an altar was taking place until today.

God knows the sacrifice the best.

John 3:16 God sacrifice his one and only son. One way of sacrifice is to sacrifice one'sdenial.
Seeing others more important than yours. Give somethign more precious, and know that the receipient is more special and more precious. Sacrifice -- when you know the receipient is so happy and provide for what you give, it's a gain.

Buying Flowers for Jason is sacrifice.

Story about sacrifice on feeding the child.

Sacrificial bonding is what made the love start to born. The more the love, the more the bonding. It's really a way to rekindle our love with God.

Please do think of it as a honor to serve for God. It's through people.

ARK(act of random kindness.)
- your heart starts to pump afterwards.
- how do you serve for GOd under ARK?
    - pastor james didn't live with parents for the longest time.
    - it's the first sweater that was bought.
    - He then give the sweater to his homeless friend.
        - he then gave the sweater to the guy
 
Pastor James was happy for him.
Pastor James felt more alive and annointed after he gave away his sweater.

It's probably not a bad idea to ask for ARK from God.

People are indeed hungry and need of ARK.

Do not be worry. II Corithians 8:12.
- Gift is acceptable to what one has, not one that does not have enough.

Sacrifice is the second wave to rekindle with our God.

Pastor Tong - If you give and serve with out feeling alittle bit of heart ache, it's sacrificing.

**Do you think you're really giving out of your comfort Ã¸ne**

## Step Out(Awakening Check)

If you're awake or Not. When Queen Esther reached out for the king, that is another form of awakening check.

Are you exercising your faith crazy for the Lord? Is your love for God awaken? ARe oyu open to respond to do things with God.

Joshua 1:6-9

**be strong and courageous** 6
**be strong and courageous** 7 
**be strong and courageous** 9 

If it's something that we resonante with, then we are indeed stepping out of faith.

If not, then it's something to re-iterate to think about.

You have to step out by faith to extend and spread out.

19 years old is the first time Pastor James preached in English.
- it was hard for pastor james to preach for the large crowd.
- front was filled with people receiving the alter call.
- it's because pastor james are saying yes to the impossible things.
    
Pray that this year is the year with solitude with God. Sacrificial giving and offering. By faith, try something new.
