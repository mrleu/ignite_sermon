Pastor Dean

We can't study science unless there's a pattern to follow. 

God Spoke into it.


Words explain, make something usable and manageble.

Two things that brought things into existence:

**spirit**

**word**

Now god wants it to be in it everyday. God wants us to give high praise, spirit energize worship, and have two edge sword(teaching, explanation, prophecy)

Both are supernatural. They are source of God himself. Anything is possible.

honor for all for all of his saints priase to the Lord.

While we worship, something is being activated in the spirit world. Pastor wants us to focus a bit more on the spirit world. It helps to get the spiritworld into cyberspace. 

Matrix is not miles away. It's not in a location. The matrix is in another dimension. Spirit world is like that. Heavenly places is where God is.
God is not in the sky.

Pastor was raised to believe God is in the Sky.

God is never in the sky. He is in every presence that includes the sky.

Heaven

That's why we say God is omnipresence.

God is another dimension. 

We need to learn to access to the spirit world.

All this stuff that we can see and touch, we call it real estate, however in Bible, everything is going to be met.

Everything in this planet is going to be destroyed. 

If real world can be destroyed, how real is it? 

Where is Jesus?

Women in the well story for John's gospel -- Pastor explains the story.

Jesus immedietely flipped into the supernatural in the story. He didn't go into the Jewish tradition.

If we access God, we need to access God through spirit and truth.

We must worship him in spirit and truth.

We must access him in experiential. That's what God wants. He wants us to experience him. Singing worship is not about content, we want to be blesesd by what we are saying.

We sing lyrics over and over to have it resonate us in our heart. It's becaues we are yielding outselves into the music. It's experiencing God, being in his presence to be encouraged. Here in church is to interface with God. We want to use this time to see his goodness.

Sometimes we repeat it over and over to fully experience it.

We worship on the surface because God is worthy for the worship. Worship God is experiencing in Truth. That's why we need to be more aware and knowledgable about how we can access God in the spirit.

Ephesian 6 says we don't battle flesh adn blood.  We are not aagainst natural stuff, not political ideology.

We are fighting against ruler, and principality.

World forces against this dark, wicked spirit in the heavenly realm -- spirit world.

Dean is coached by teh holy spirit to be a little omre confident and aware to access the spirit world from both side.

He wants to encourage us to a little bit more aware and intentional to connect with the spirit world.

By product of our worship, we are affecting society. Santa clara spirit was affectd this morning. We were fighting against demonic forces. They were shutting down as we were worshipping.

Demonic voices are the ones that said there is no God.

We are tackled by lies in teh spirit realm. 

Dean has been doing it in half a century. Doesn't take the same thing from the non-believers everytwhere to say the same thign. there's probably a common source.

THere's athiests everywhere.

Hearing it many times made dean realizes there must be a common source for people to denounce God.

We have a god that is a spirit, and we also have a demon that is a spirit.

Spirit does two things -- it talks and has power.

By product of your worship, the spirit of GOd is activated.

Powerful things hapen when you worship.

2nd Chronicles 20

King Jahosavah sents singers out to the 3 armies. 3 national military. ahead of the army, he sents choir.

There must be supernatural invovlement for hte choir to kill the military by the sinigng. It's not by power, it's by spirit.

His supernatural power needs to show up.

As you worship everytime you do, you are activating the spirit and the power is expanding.

**God Speaks**

God blinds the mind(coming from 2nd chronicles)

people belive in stupid stuff(heresy, lies, cult)

Enemy is also constantly talking to us. When we worship, we silence those mind. More prone to hear from God in this room, because Dean would really hear God here. He gets the hope of lord when he is in meeting like this.

God spirit gets activated more, and devil attack gets held off. This is one of the reason why you would go to church.
