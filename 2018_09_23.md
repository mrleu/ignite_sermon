        - as they praise, the enemies were all defeated by God.
        - God will fight the battle for you.
        - you have to *depend on God*
    - so many problems can't solve by money/can't be dealt with on your own; list can go on and on.
    - whatever problem you can not solve, can only be surpass it. 
      - **Praise is to observe your situation from God's perspective**
        - one who lives with us is great than the world.
