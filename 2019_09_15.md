_Theme we had this seaon_

It's __Expand and Upgrade__

What theme was in 2018?
    - Shikinah Glory Breakthrough Annointing.
    - as if there's boulder in front of you
        - boulder gets removed.

Physical Manifestation.
    - Shikinah Glorth is completed.
    - Ignite also got breakthrough annointing.
        - Used to meet in el shiddai
        - we moved into emmanuel

Had more space to grow.

2019
    EXPAND and UPGRADE
        - most messages is about more Love, Acceptance, Unity, Working well with others.

## Expansion
_If we don't have these things, it's very hard to expand._

if you don't feel love/welcomed, you'd go somewhere else.
    - one thing to work through is that we've been in for awhile, there's lots of heart issue.
        - wants to be posture where we're ready for it.

Summer, we had historical highs.

Future - God really has put expansion in our group. We can feel the physical aspect. They feel like over 50% are new people.
    Lots of new people.

There are people that prayed for people to come here.

Numbers always give weired taste in mouth - negative connotation with numbers.

Make Disciples of all nations.
    - how to make disciples of all nations w/o man power
    - need people to do enormous task
    - need people to do youtube/podcast
    - teach seminary.

When we lose our focus, when numbers become our goal, we'd do something wrong.
Nothing wrong with numbers if we have a greater goal.

## Upgrade
we think of _better_
Not going back to what we had before.
    - for example, high speed internet is hard to go to lower speed.

After upgrade, you'd experience more of the differences more.
Same thing for spiritual life.

It's weird, cuz we don't see spiritual life like that as much.
    - lot of times we were _ok_ getting by.

God is supernaturally annointing to the leaders in the group.
    - God is putting hunger for more into the group.

John 14:12-17

Jesus said his disciples will do greater things than what he was doing.
    - crazier things.

Whole church, we've been doing that.
    - Christians had been preaching gospel all around the world.
    - Daughter churches in 29 countries.
    - Jesus never went to Napal.

Individual level
    - today pentecost in Acts2 speak in different tongue.
    - didn't do it when they were with Jesus.
        - disciples did that after jesus's ressurection
        - Peter was healing to sick
            - wasnt don't it when Jesus was around.

Disciples are doing things that Jesus didn't do.
    - reach to the entire planet in few seconds.

Jesus had given us to do greater things.

W/e we do in Jesus's name.

Qualifier - what God may be glorified.

How many of us live our lives and thinking about it.

What is holding us back from believing it.
    - Fear of looking stupid.
    - fear of men

When you success, it brings more spiritual attack.
- does not want the blessing that comes with it.
- lack of faith
- lack of conviction
    - lack of commitment.

For the things to _pursue_, you'd need to do _something_.

__What is it that is holding you back to pursue greater things__

Pursue greater things require you to let go of comfort zone.
    - gets to the unknown.

Maybe it's because we don't know how to do it.
    - John 14:15-17
    - God will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever.

Holy Spirit is the hardest to understand.
    - ZPJ is going to try to talk about holy spirit.
    - Holy Spirit is here to help you, spirit of truth.

We all believe Spirit is with us, and power us.
    - we believe it by faith.
    - if we don't, it's really hard to understand it.
        - when we try to look at spirit in academic(non christian point of v)
            - it's hard.

Have faith that the spirit is working with you and in you.
    - he will teach you _all things_

Holy spirit will teach you all things.
    - often times we don't know

Disciples probably does not know what to do when Jesus had died.
    - longer that jesus gone, people continues to change.
    - by faith the whole new testatment, People were all led by the holy spirit

Spirit gives different types of gifts. 1 corith 12:4-11
    - same God at work -- different that is working.

Gifts
----------------
1. wisdom
1. knowledge
1. faith
1. healing
1. powers
1. prophecy
1. distinguish spirit
1. speaking in diff tongues
1. interpretation of tongues

Help people to advance the gospel

Our church believes in all these.

This is how God operates.
    - some of us, God will provide supernatural wisdom
    - some people might have supernatural knowledge.
    - some of us would have the gifts given by the spirit.

It's open to hear it through worship and prayer.
People would share stuff that they see in the spirit.

We are all figuring it out together.


We should not have a fear to pusue it juse because we have not figured it out.

There is more to God then to start/end on time.

ZPJ wants to open up the environment to be able to do these things.

Different speakers will come and say different ways of spiritual gifts
    - there's principles, but God uses these people differently.

Under church leadership that these things happened.

When you pursue greater things, it's harder to put reports.

ZPJ asks the lead to pray with him every week.
    - see how the prayer meeting goes.
    - Hebrews 11:6
    - what's the best way to do it in the body.
