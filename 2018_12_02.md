Good to join ignite worship.

People who give thanks is also people give appreciation.
Person who give thanks have many friends.

1 Thessalonians 5:16-18

- don't take love for granted.

The power to give thanks.

It's something that is so important that God has yield for us.

The biggest question is what is God's will for God?

It is clear in 1 Thessalonians 5:16. When you do this thing, God's blessing will come to you. it will come into your life through Christ Jeuss.

We will tackle how to give thanks in all circumstances. Not just one season, but all year around.

**It is a choice to give thanks**

### I. Give thanks is a choice you have to make.

Similar to what Girls wants to wear for the church. It will not happen in the beginning. It is a choice to tell yourself that it's God's choice for you.
It is not a natural reaction, and we have cognizantly provide it. If you don't give thanks, you will easily go into complaints. We complain because we compare.
Compare ==> Complaints. It will not lead you to give thanks. Complain will affect your relationship with your coworker. Two millions peoples were in teh wilderness in the Moses era while walking around ind essert. A lot of died came from the cause of death of complaints.

Numbers 11:5-6. someone who complain because they compare. They beging to complain about what they have done back in Egypt. Even when God has sent Manna everyday, but yet the people are still complaining. You tend to forget things that need to *remember*.

They forget that they're now free. They're free from bondage. When you compare, you start to complaints. We need to learn to give thanks in all circumstances.

It will change your attitude -- even though it will not chnage your circumstances. When you beging to give thanks, you start to give a different perspective.

You can even see brighter side in the *very dark things*.

Pastor Hingchai brings in the half glass full/empty terminology..

WHen you see glass half empty, you start to see their short comings instead of their real strength.

WHen it's half full, you want to praise the Lord.

We need to adjust our mind, because we tend to see things half empty. If we give thanks in everything, it changes how we think. You beging to

#### A. Don't compare but give thanks

#### B. Give thanks will not change your circumstances, but it will elevate your life.

- begin to see things in God's perspective.
- begin to see their strength
- able to see the power to give thanks.

Phil 4:12-13.

Paul wrote these in prisons.

It used to be a dungeon.

Paul was very influential person at the time.

Learned the secrets of being content. Ican do everything through him who gives me strength.

What's the secret? give thanks in **all**.

- even in the worst ones.
- it changes our attitude in three area that god gives to us.

### Give thanks will elevate your life.

#### A. You wil have joy in the midst of suffering

You stop looking at the chain that is up on your feet. You can then experience joy in the midst of suffering. THe most joyful letter Paul ever written is in the Phillipeans.

There are only 4 chapters, but it contains bunch of joy/glad. THere are average 4 times per chapter, and written 17 times in teh book. He wrote it when he was in prison. His secret comes from giving thanks.

Paul chooses to give thanks. He is reminded that there are people that really have loved him. He rejoice greatly in the Lord. From the beginning of the Gospel ministry, the people of Phillipeans had been loyaled to follow Paul. some people left in the beginning because they were in fear of their situation if they were to follow Paul.

If you feel like no one like you anymore, be reminded that God loves you the most.

##### think of those who love you the most

##### think of those who you love the most

Phil 4:1.
- he is someone who is the most purpose driven.
- Paul remembers the people he loves th most.

Learn to give thanks to the lord.

#### B. You will be contend in all circumstances.

There are good times and bad times.

Bad/good times can also drive you away from God depending on your attitude.

Think about what had God done in your good time, so that you can know God more.

Phil 4:11. 

##### Good times help you know GOd More. 

Phil 4:19 - God will meet your needs accoding in God's glorious Riches.
The blessing is passed over, reaches from God bedcause we are in Christ Jesus.

##### Bad times will help you know God deeper.

holy communion. God is going to be hte lamb that will be killed on teh slaughter. He is even giving thanks for his own death.

jesus chose to give thanks for his death
- also give thanks for his blood that is ot pour out to fogive the sins.

Receives in the most cruel way of him dying.

hebrew 12:2
 He see the joy before it all. It's god's love for all. he give thanks.

He had the last supper because he know what is to come.

### C. Yo uwill revenwe your stregnth when you're weak.

2nd Corith 12:10. 

Paul said he deilght in his weaknesses .

Phil: 4-13. 

` I can do all things thorugh him who gives me strength.`

#### III Practice to give thanks everyday.

Because you can a smile on your face instead of a cucumber face.
