## Speaker: Pastor Fred Mok

Retreat with bunch of 40 years old
    - one of the guy shared that he wished in highschool there's someone that he could look up to that would watch out for him
    - feels like a sense of lost-ness

Usually You don't get to see the people that are left behind. Youth ministry is impactful because that's how people are well taking stuff in.
It's a privilledge -- and you don't get to see the impact.

Talking with PJ, he brought up the topic about **Dating**

### Dating
quite important to Pastor Fred Mok

Thinking about it in the standpoint of his church, rolcc, and josh harris

Josh Harris - *I kissed dating goodbye*
- when he was in berkeley
- he got an audio casette tape of the talk

Courship and dating

Pastor Mok is going to defend a bit of his book -- hopefully presents some alternatives

Talk about value and challenges to date within church.
- principle to go through it in a godly way.
- he hopes we can find something encouragin as to how we relate one another in the body of Christ.

Colossians 3:1-17

In the passage there's an idea of raising with Christ. Source of the identity is in heaven.
- perspective in world view in based on above, not on earth.
- meant to refledct spiritual respective, and not an earthly one.

Dating does not *appear* in the bible.
- be suspicious.
- bible does not address topic; however it does show how to conduct our lives.

### Critiques of Josh Harris' book " I kissed dating good bye"

He tries to offer a script for courtship.
- step by step break down of what things should do

Script you don't think about

Script only works in *certain context*

Only has a certain outcome

When principle is offered, not all outcome is coming out. When script does not work out, you can have something to blame. Principles do not guarantee outcome, so the responsibility also goes into yourself too(and other things outside of your own control.)

Josh harris was critiqued that if you save yourself from premarital sex, the sex at marraige is mind blowing. Pastor Fred Mok is saying that sex could be "MEH"

Be careful when they said something is going to be _amazing_

__Colossians 3:16-17__

### Merging Tracks
Everyone has their own soundtrack, and in an community there's a soundtrack too.
There is aboslutely a soundtrack that is in the community of God - invovles songs/hyms/psalms. We are also meant to be singing it to each other.

Value the siblign soundtrack, 2) recongize your won sound track, 3) merging requires forgives sound track

Dances - phases of dance/wedding. When there's a transition to slow songs, most people leave the floor. It's weird to dance in a circle. non-couples would get off of the dance floor.

Soundtrack that is coming out of us, and we need to appreciate that soundtrack.

People do realize the volume of their soundtrack that is coming out of them. Dating in church is hard because you switch tracks.

### Value the sibling Soundtrack

Colossiasn 3:5-8

You don't live by earth's culture anymore! Josh Harris is a forefront of purity culture. They have been under attacked recently. Prohibition againist purity is from the _bible_

The way you conduct yourself in the relationship is very important. We live in a culture of immediete gratification -- that's where the idea of sex comes in.

People that are most susciptible to sexual sin found dis-connection in the rest of the body. Sexuality is about how we relate to another person. When people struggled through it, they have hard time connecting with the rest of the churches. Sex is a substitute to a community -- accept acceptance.

Men approach it as a sense of dominance. Women sees it as a way of affection.

Healthy relationships that can help us remain pure -- it stems from us from keeping pure.

Book "Cheap Sex" -- people fall away from sex starts off from how they face sexuality. It reflects how we see relationships

__purity is important__

*Sibling Sountrack* - culture of immediate gratification starts to approach.

We are meant to be brothers and sisters to each other. We are meant to prioritize it. It's not about immediete gratification -- it's about encouragement.

Context of how we pursue relationship is to be encouraging to one another.

What is it like in practical speaking? SO hard to get to know people in the church. People met online on the same church

There's an issue of people spending time in groups. Group time feels strange. Group dates is common in church.

Group event is not hard to pay attention in their context -- being able to neutrally edifying from one another.

Place great emphasis on being siblings. Serving ministry to other people. You get to see peopel in different context. being able to serve with another you get to learn more.

She notices the real-ness of him when he does not take full attention in long distance.

Would you recognize in marriage, most things are super unromantic -- especially when you have kids.
    - marriage romance dies for decades.

becoming Parent, it would feel more like a team. romance changes. Most satisfaction is being a team.

### Be honest with your own soundtrack

Colossians 3:9

Do not lie to each other. Visit a bible study, did not know the people that were there. The two women felt him preaching is insensitive. THey felt like there's an inconsistence of him being the pastor. At tha moment, he was out of sync of being a pastor.

There an out of sync-ness at dance track when someone sent in out of sync. there needs to be a transition.

Turns out the two women did not see him as a friend, they see him as a pastor. People see Pastor, they usually get tightened up.

Why online dating is easy -- everyone agrees to what the soundtrack is. There's no transition back. There needs to be honestry and leadershpi for you to switch tracks.

Guys are unaware of the track switching -- pay attention. When being at an intervention, ask a mentor, or see how they respond. Ask people who are going to be honest with you in that soundtrack.

#### DTR

If we use the soundtrack metaphor, DTR is an opportunity to spent time talking to be on the same soundtrack.

There's an element for guy to be explicit. It although sounds super awkward, and most guys don't want to do that.

##### WHY?
- there's a fear of rejection. When you make a suggestion to swtich track, the person can say no. the fear of rejection is a big obstacle. pastor mok did say he wanted to switch track. He knew he had to risk his friendship. Important for guy to overcome the fear of rejection. Dating apps are not _going away_, but they delay the rejection. Ghosting exists cuz people are afraid to say that it's not going to work. Can you go through to face rejection and have girls feel honest to say rejection.

Girl should give all guys a chance. When you know that there is never going to be a chance, be firm. You are doing them a favor by giving them some time by stating something that is never going to happen.

Colossians 3:12

Switch tracks needs to have some gentleness. Pastor MOk is very grateful to have friendship where he can be fully himself. He appreciates that he can switch tracks. He has guys in the church that are legitimately brothers -- where they see him outside of the pastor soundtrack. It will take time to transition to take that.

### Marriage is the merge of tracks

Bear with each other and forgive one another

Successful Marraige - ability to navigate conflict. ANy relationships is about navigating conflicts. _when_ anyone have grievance with another, it is to value the ability to go through conflicts.

Chemimstry -- maybe crucify that, and not value it as much. Would you value instead hte compatibility and how you navigae conflict with each other. It's about how well you go through with it. People are bad at it to start off with..

Pastor Mok's wife has like silent melt down. Where Pastor mok gets angry often, and only focusd on himsef. God has showed them how to navigate their conflicts.

Pastor MOk went ot HK and Taiwan. His wife lost it cuz he has pattern misplacing people's stuff. She knew she was irrational, but she oculdn't help it.

This time she went up first and initiated it. How we _deal with it is important_

Those that are married loved narrow, those that are celebacy(sp) loves wide

__We are meant to merge together with Christ__

Colossians 3:11

Whether there's something different about you, it does not matter. In Christ -- all merges together. Can we exemplifies that
