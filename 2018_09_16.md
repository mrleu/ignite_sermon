# Pastor Jason Betler

## Ushered today.

Moses 
- having doubt on leading people out to the promise land.

Exocuds 33:15
- Moses doesn't want to go w/o God's presence.

Visions
- questions: would God's presence go with you.
- part of what faith is, what it is about.

Hebrews 11:1
- verse about faith. evidence of things unseen.

Hebrews 11:6
- w/o faith is impossible to please God.
- faith is something you do

God is real.
- he rewards those who diligently seek him.

We walk/do by faith, but the primary of having faith is to seek God.
- purpose of having faith.
Faith is directed towards God. w/o God, you can't do what God calls u to do.

if you have faith in God, it should _draw_ you into God.
- not by situation/circumstances.

Child of God would want to _be with God_

God reward those who seek him. if you want to go through the difficult situations, you need to start _seeking_ God.

Become someone who seeks in God.

Isaiah 55
- seek God while he may be found.

something about the presence of worship.
worship goes into the presence of God.
Question: what is the presence of God? Presence of God is _not an emotion_

Being in the _presence_ changes the way you act/speak. As you're seeking the presence, it is changing something. 
you want to know what God _thinks_
- seek for his wisdom, guidance, and his way

As you worship, you forget the struggle that you had on this earth. Suddenly, they don't seem to matter as much anymore.

When you are seeking God, all these things are starting to melt away.
- you'll get the revelation of who God is.

It's not just a person of who God is, there's an environment that supports the product he's about to create.

Presence of God, there's this environment that you want to be in. It sustains you in this environment of his presence.

He's forming you and refashion you into something that represents _God_.
- For those who seek after him, will become the product of God that can be carried in this world.

### Presence of God

Practice of the presence of God.
What does it mean? Being with God, and being in presence of God. Seek God in everything. You are with God, and God is with you.

Act in such a way that God is in the presence.

Opportunity to become bitter will get smaller, you'd forgive right away.

The way you act/respond would be different.

When you are seeking God, all these things will come together. You are awakening when you are seeking him.
- the awaken/awareness of God. The fear of God. oh man this reminds me of Tim keller -- how the fear of God is parallel towards the overwhelming of God.

What you think about God is more important than other people who think about you.

As the promise God made for you is as real as he is, it brings the certainty.
GOd made a promise to you, and follow through with the oath.

He made an oath to **HIMSELF**
So if he breaks his promise with you, he breaks himself.

God is a rewarder, and lead the promise just as he would lead himself.

Promise is real. THey do not _change_

### Side Story 
- travel to Indonesia.

Achor doesn't move because it holds you.
Hope that you have in Jesus.
This is happening behind the veil, what we don't see anymore.

the hope you have, you don't know exactly what's there completely yet.

something tells you that you are _anchored_ to God.

devil tries to get to you, because he could not get to God.

So importantly to be healthy in the Lord.

If you don't have hope, you'd get toss through and get nothing.

If you believe the promises of God, you'd get hope.

Capital P for presence.

Hope should be in God.

If you seek God, you will renew your hope in _God_.

Devil can try to change the way that you feel about God.

#### Believe his purpose in all of this!

Old people would want to know as well
God isn't as obessed about where you're going. Trust the Lord all your heart. He will make you path _straight_
- he will make you moving, especially moving towards him.

Series of seeking God in the church. 
- asked God what he wants.
- Pastor Jason reminded himself of Abraham/Moses how they talk to Jesus 

All about the presence with God

Eph1
- What does God want? the mystery of his will, he purposesly made it in such way for you to become the child of God.

Phil 11:16
Luke 12:32

Grow up so God can trust you with his responsibiilty.

Imagine how God feels if we keep on seeking him out. it'd bring out God's joy

### What if you don't feel like speaking to God?
Acts 3:19.
- somethings you may want to get away
- just do it. it's never about your feeling. He is _calling you_, even when you're not calling him.

Refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.

Seek after God, turn around, and let GOd remove all things that you're ashamed of.
