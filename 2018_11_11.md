Age that dominates in this room is dominating the society. A lot of
leadership demands attention and protest. All of us should know how we can really lead that represents the leader of the **universe**

How come God gets to be god?

God becomes God because of power. If we only have leadership that comes from power, then that's called oppression, rape, injustice. Power has led a lot in our history. We have been ashamed of it. This is called *colonization*.

We are actually hurt and upset over that power has led through out our history and our race. Leaders don't lead from their power. This is why we spend time worshipping God. We don't worship God for his power. We worship God for his impeccable character. The reason we *want* him to be our God is because he does have character. We don't want God to lead because he has power. We call this type of power *holy*. We call and response that God is holy, he has impeccable, questionable power.

Those who represent God should be *representing God* not because we have power. Studying church history -- Pastor Dean. When the church rule when it has power, it's always vomiting of a story. From living 50+ years, there have been horrror stories of how people view the faith of christianity. Those of us that are questions that want to take leadership -- We need to learn out of our *character*, not power.

The only reason we should *lead* and represent *our god* is out of **character**. 

Bible time: Romans 5:12 -- where it talks about leadership in home life and influencing society. Sin == bad character. Holy and sin are two opposite. We are participating in bad practicer because of our bad character. We then learn how to gain good character by becomign more holy. 

If by the trepasses of the sin, the dis-obedeince, death could regin the entire human race.  The truest thing Pastor can say is that death reigns. Everyone in this room is going *to die*. It came from a decision that is made by a *human.* 

It happened because a human has cut its source away from God.


## Eternal Life
THus, Jesus Christ came to live with us to atone to the discretion that has brought death. He came back into life to reverse the death for whoever that believes it. John 3:16 -- having eternal life.

If you have the resurrection brought, you get the eternal life for whoever that wants it.

How much more of the obedience in life can we reign in life. Reign == Leadership. If we want to lead a good life, we would ask ourselves what type of life we do want to have. It reflects the way we handle relationships, handle money, etc. It's all in the influence in us. How do we take control of our own life, and influence the society into the good direction. It can't happen just because we claim ourselves to be christian. How we lead then comes from our *character*. We would lead in our character by abudence provision embracce of God's righteousness.

Pastor gave us a declaration that the character of God is inside of all of us. People had embarrassed us when people just voted because they call themselves christianity, and be seen as a christian but does not reflect the character of God. We need to first receive free gift of righteousness that is given to us. It is not because we were behaved, but it was given even when we are not behaving. This is essentially the concept of Grace.

Jesus takes the cross and carries the sin, so we can become something that we *did not choose.* It was given to us because Jesus died, and carry the punishment that is given to us. This should esseentially set us up to lead others and do by example.

The abudence provision of Grace is the second character to have. It is a well known religious form. It means the god's riches in god's expense. It's the unlimited favor. What is it really? It is the initiation of others to take from good character. HOw to interfaces others int eh face of reality. THe key is to dispense grace. This is how God gives us his holiness. He does not deal with us in justice, he deals with us in grace. If he deals with us in justice, then we would probably fail. It's because we are all sins, and we would have to carry our sins.

## Mercy

Mercy is zero sum. It is something that you don't get for what you deserve. It's another reason why we worship God. God is providing mercy, because Jesus is taking is for us. Grace is not **zero sum**. Grace is not just an attitude of God.

Amazing Grace. It is because Jesus paid, God is able to show mercy to what we don't deserve, and he is also able to dispesnse the quality of grace that we don't desreve. We were receiving the supernatural amount of grace. How we lead by society is through grace. God is leading the universe basing on his holiness. It is by his sin-less character. WHich is why he is worthy to be called of God.

We call him holy because it is an impeccable character from God. This is how we should also behave to one and to another. What we just said would make any marriage work. LOL. It would get ride of racism, injustice, gender bias. 

## God's promise of his Character

Pastor promises us that no matter how big the group it would be, that the church could lead people in direction with out oppression and demandd. You can lead by influence if you become the person of grace. The only alternative is through domination. What's going on in society in dominance is an anarchy. People want to dominate based on the power. Someone needs to come along and demonstrate that with huge power, but still chooses not to. God does not do them, even though he has all the power. This almighty God let's you *sin*. That is grace. It's a god that don't dominate you, to give you choice to serve God. Theoretically, God could manipulate us, but he does not do it. 

God will let us *curse him*, not believe in him. God is not insecure and does not retaliate. God does not defend himself.

This is why we are glad that he is our God. The impeccable character can be summed up as Grace. It is giving us something that we don't deserve. This shalls that we should learn to give grace to each other, or else this society is unable to run on its own. It would go out of control if we only use our power to get the things back. Jesus has paid, justice has done on the cross, which is why we should embrace people that are wrong.

The sinful character of people are many things, however God so love the world that he gave his son to die over sin so that he has the ability to give us grace. We don't represent Christ unless we are doing this.

### Start giving Grace to people that are wrong.

God takes care of the judgetment, not us. The way to sin is death. Leave room for the wrath of God. "I don't have the character to make people pay. Only God can be that judge. I am not smart nor good enough to bring judgement to people."

Non-christians are not going to give grace. Unfortuantely they sometimes do give more grace to Christian. How to give the truth of the bible and the God to permeate the society? Don't just yell at others for doing the wrong thing. Start showing grace and forgiveness to people.

THat is what represents God. They will know we are God's disciples if we 'love each other.  '

Calling out is not one of the gift of the spirit. God is the one who judges people. He is the only one with all the good qualify to make these decisions. we are *already screwed up*. Definitely not in the character to judge somebody.

Every relationshp that is known to people. All that people try to deal with can be ammended right here. God was reconciling the world -- bringing new relationship back together. Reconciliation is bringing people back together.

Grace is not just getting what we don't deseve. It is a divine ability to be what you need to be, and to go through anything you want to go through. It's a supernatural enabler. when you said you're saved by Grace. Although the pastor sinned, and he was dead in his sin, we are looking at the sinless person. He is alive, not dead in christ. How can a violator say this?  Grace is enabling us to be rightenous. It makes us alive to not be dead in our sin. 

"I am being enabled to be saved, to be a christian, to be a son of GOd, by grace."

## Grace is also an ability to *do*

Paul says he receives the ministry by the power of God's grace. MInistry and gift of GOd. To each one, grace has been given.

By studying the new testament, Grace is given to much of what you do than why you have been said about *saving grace.*  We used to assume grace only applies to salvation, but it is the divine ability to do what we need to do.

Paul asks to get thing away, but GOd says God's grace is sufficient to go through suffering by his divine ability to go through stuff. We say to give others grace when we want  to give them ability to cope through *pain*.

The Book of Titus has said this grace of God is given to all people. THe ability to be saved is through grace. It then enables to to train. We are trained by doing, not just by reading a book about it.

This is a *training*, and gives us the ability to live a Godly upbright holy life. 

"I am a christian by grace. I am being enabled to be saved right now. Grace also continuously gives me the ability to live above sin."

It enables us to say not o un-godlyness. Grace gives us ability ot say no in the present and the future.

We need some character in society right now. If you asked them what they think about christians, they would talk about all those that had horrible character. We do not need another religion to make bad character people. we need people that are manifested the character of God the universe. That is what is should be, how we should give grace, justice, kindness, and all the characteristic that can be manifested through us.

Three other words that talk about Grace: 1) free, 2) abundunt(which we just read), 3) sufficient.

Ephesians said the grace ise given freely. If we worked/deserved it, then it isn't grace. This is because Grace is un-merited and free. It's a free gift of Grace based on what jesus did for us. We only need to raise our hand to receive it. God is offering us a free gift of righteousness and enternal lfie.

Secondly, grace is **abundent**. It is more than enough. Grace is way more than we'll ever need -- abundent provision. You will always have more abundently enabling. He is an abundent God. There is an unbundent ability called Grace that you're able to do what you need to do.

**Suffiicent**: looking up the greek word it means 'cut to provision'. It is not one size fits all. It is waht God make a special gift per person and per context. He measures the size of hte shape fo hte issue of your life, and cuts out hte piece of Grace that is exactly shaped ans sized, so that it fits into your situaiton. It is not a situation generic. God cuts out grace, so it is precise to what your need is. It is cut through precision. There is the grace to the age you are. Twenty-fives don't get grace of the twenty sixes. The point is there is grace for whawtever you are. There is grace to be single. IT's not generic married grace. It's grace to be married to that person. God dispenses to the abiliyt of Grace to put into the situaiton taht you need to be in. THat is one that is specific to what job you are part of. There is a grace to learn and to stop for hte stressful times. The idea is to receive grace for all tehse
