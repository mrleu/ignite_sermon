Genesis

- wedding celebration
- five themes

Genesis 28

## Issac, who marries Rebecca.

- you must not married cannaite woman
- go back to homeland to marry the mother side family

## Jacob

What is his displacement? It's a bit different.

- he get kicked out of his family, because he stole the birth right and blessing from Esau
-  Esau Wanted to kill him.
-  it's a large stone that takes a number of men to move to stone
-  Rachel came with the brother. Heroic water deliver that was done by Jacob, so that Rachel's family can water the flocks.

We have wedding celebration. What's particular about the wedding celebration is that there's alcohol that may be involved that caused Jacob to accidently married Rachel. 

1. Displacement
2. Well
2. Quest
3. Heroic Act
3. Wedding Celebration

## Exodus - Moses Story.

Now in Exodus when you see a well, you would think Moses is going to get a wife. It's important to recognize these pattern. Moses's displacement is that he killed an Egyptian Man. Theme of Moses's life is defending these women.Water delivery is still repeatable pattern.

Three events that happen, however does it happen in John 4?

## John 4

Jesus was baptizing more people than John. He has to pass through Samaria. The displacement is that he is leaving Jewish territory. He is no longer in his homeland; going to a difference place. 

**History of Samaritans** 

They were descended from Jews. Their lineage is Jewish, however it was change because of the marriage. 

The well was Jacob's well that is given to his son Jospeh in John 1. When you see well, think wife. Here's the story for the woman of Samaria. Jews view Samaritan as a unclean people. Jesus emphasizes there's living water. Narrator mentions Jacob, now the woman also mentions Jacob. She is claiming the Hebrew Lineage.

Observation 

1. Numerous repetitions in water and worship
2. jacob is repeated 3 times
3. husband repeated 5 times
4. father repeated 5 times

God was not mentioned. Father is mentioned. Jesus is talking about the common father. Jesus then stayed with the Samaritans. There is a celebration for two days.

Fred Mok asked who is the pride. The people from the town believed the woman's testimony. There is a pattern that is repeated all along. Hebrew reader would be sensitive to know it's a story about a wife and displacement for people.

Samaritans had gotten lost through intermarriage -- even though they were descendents of Abraham. The Samaritans married the wrong husbands. This whole people become lost to the Jews. They are cut off from the Jewish Lineage. The samaritan is the bride. God has restored the people back. It's not about the woman. The quest is to reunite the family that has been lost. It is true that God seeks out in lost individuals. We tend to read them individually. Immigrants that displaced from the family where we came from. All of us seek out the wrong husband. This could come out from cultural idolatry. This is how we are alienated from our family.

All of our alienation deviates away from our father. Jesus is bringing us back. every one of us has been displaced from the garden. The key is to go back to the city -- going back. 

Going back to the full circle. Jesus was dispalced in heaven, He is comission to get bride. to dleivery living water for hte celbration. Jesus displacd from heaven journeys on a quest to reunite his family with the Father and bring them to the wedding celebration. 

Millenials experienced lonliness. Pastor Mok claimed that we have all getting more alone. God wants to restore the lonliness. As we more to the new place, the encouragement that there is so much room to invite people into the world of God. Important to have empathy to bring people back to their faith.
