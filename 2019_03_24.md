## Pastor Marques.

There's some ground work to see fruition of God in the mission trip.
The thing to do is a fast in the church. A lot of churches do daniel fast in the first 30 days of the year.
The prophet said they're going to do another 30 day fast. SO they did another 30 days.

Equipping the students every wedneday. Sunday they want them to call in prayer line. They wanted to gain ground in practical things, and gain ground in the spirit.
What's done in spirit is manifested here.

**We are not just believing**

There's work we need to do to be contend with breakthrough.

Bible about women who's contend with breakthrough.

## Mark chapter 5.

The Flow of blood of the woman.

Reflection: Scholar said the flow fo blood are two possibilities: 1) it could be a heavy menstral cycle. It would just overextend. 2) she may have hemorrhoids. 
- issues would create other issues.

According to Jewish law, this issue made her unclean. She couldn't come to church because she is unclean. It affects her relationship with God. If she sits on the chair, it would have been seen as unclean. She begans to live in a life of separation.

Devil lkes to take moments for separation. She needed Jesus to be the lord of the breakthrough to breakthrough. She has to be contend.

Physical demonstration of the woman's contend.

She is touching other people as she is going close to Jesus. People were getting in the way, she was making people unclean by going to them. If the woman thinks that she didn't want people to go unclean, she wouldn't have touched Jesus.

Sometimes you can receive a breakthrough. If you feel like you're going to show other people that you have problems, it will be our perspective that get into the way. The multitude is the first obstacle that gets her from getting to Jesus.

There's another obstacle, that's Jairus.

TEES - is pronounced tiss tiss. When there's someone in the bible that isn't being named, it is really someone who is not special. We come to feel like we're just certain person.

Gyrass daughter also needed healing, but she was dying. We felt like other people's problem is bigger than ours, so we just waited in line -- thinking that we're not special.

To God, *any* problem is small to God. That's because God is so big.

We need to be sure to not fall into a trap.

Healing is two fold:

    1. v34. Mark saw her as a woman someone who didn't know, but Jesus knows her. He said "daughter, your faith had made you well" We are not body in Jesus's Eyes. That's how we pursue Jesus. I am not just certain person, I am special to Jesus.
    1. Jesus can teach. There's always layer upon layer. 
        1. he was teaching Jairus. 
            1. he came because his daughter was dying.
            1. he wants his daughter to be healed.

Jesus uses `daughter` to signifies his love for the woman.

The woman also had the issues for 12 years. Jairus's daughter is also 12 years old(the one that is dying). It is being known as perfect faith, government.

There's a perfect faith building for us, but sometimes we don't prioritize it. We sometimes come to church and hear good things, and we just think about our own issues, we can't  even celebrate our own new victory.

When you pray for something, and people got the same thing that you were praying for. It feels like you'd ask the lord "WHAT ABOUT ME"

When Pastor M wanted to get married, he remembered his older brother that he wanted to do so much when he is married, yet he still felt a bit of a flesh of selfishness. The pator had to tell him "Son, wait for your time"

It hits him again when his baby sister got married. That's when he realized he still didn't have a date for the marraige. He is actually totally missing this.

Let's learn this new thing instead -- this celebration/rejoice. This celebration is not meant to destroy us, it is meant to encourage us.

This is why we see, we should learn to celebrate for the praises for Jesus. Jesus had done all these break through.

The woman in the mark had to be contend, and had to pass through securities to get through to Jesus. They have to press through to not just celebrating, but a break through.

Then there's this area of faith. When she touched the garment, it was healed, but Jesus said it was the *faith that had made her healed*.

It might have been the same posture that caused her to heal. she was spending all the money to seek men for healing. He makes us lye down.

She began to crawl, so the she could go low enough to touch jesus. Jesus wants us to humble ourselves, or get to the end of ourselvs.

Bible said God will never leave us or forsake us.

1 Peter5, Jesus said: `for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.` Pride said things can be done with out Jesus, but God is disgusted with PRIDE.

God resists us as we want to be pride by ourselves. The opposite is the humility. She had faith to be dependent to God. Her faith is also not just blind faith.

There is a layer of faith. Jairus first wanted girl to be healed, then he wanted his daughter to be resurrected.

Faith causes by healing in the God. Malachi 4

wings means corner of the garment. She knew that if she touches the garment, she would have gotten healed. she got the revelation from the wings of Jesus/garment. She put the word in her heart, when she needed to hear it, she had put upon the promise. It's important to know the word, because you never know when you need the word.

People collect mana everyday, and suppose to eat it to leave for nothing tomororw. Mana is symbolic for the `word of God`
God has asked us to taste and see that the word is real. The next time it has become maggots and worms. It said dont' take from yesterday's revelation. that's why words are always so fresh and new. This should be refreshed and fresh word in it, even though there's 300 years of silence in teh scripture, but there's reflection ihaert.

Her faith is rooted in the word of God.
