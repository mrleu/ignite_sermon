# Daniel 4

Alex Leu

## Some theme:
- God can vindicate his faithful servant in front of pagan rulers by giving them unusual wisdom and insight into divine mysteries and miraculously protecting them against hte enmity of their pegan neighbors.

## Some what happened last time:

Daniel 1 - Daniel and his friends did not eat the food from the king's table. They are much more healthier than the others.

Daniel 2 - Daniel knows King Nebby's dream + interpretation of the statue. This saves all the wise men.

Daniel 3 - Daniel's 3 friends did not bow down to king nebby's statue, which then nebby threw them into a furace, however they were all saved.

Daniel 4 theme:

God humbles the proud and raise up the humbe; even the hearts of the greatest kings are under his control.

## Outline: Nebby's dream of the toppled tree
1. nebby's dream and its interpretation
1. nebby's humbling
1. nebby's exaldation.

## Some notes..
verse 1 
- written by king nebby
- he provides blessing, and humbling to give the only God(WOAH WHAT HAPPENED)

v. 2-4
- start off nothing but blessing.
- it's a praise from King nebby. This is probably written after his recovery. 
- addressed to all peopel, nation, and language.
  - reminded me of daniel 3:7
  - all people, nation, and language fell down and worship the golden image
  - differences is that it now refers to the signs and wonders of the most high God.

king nebby used to be the persecutor, but now he is a witness to the faith.

v.4
- he was at ease in his house. He was the king, there is nothing that should make him afraid, unless it's something that he knows that is truly impactful.
- so afraid that he tells the dreams to others, rather than what hapepned in daneil 2.
- he respect Daniel, and he associates teh spirit of the holy god to Daneil.

10-16
- a holy one could be angel.
- dreams is hard to picture. pictue time!

19 -27
- daneiil was dismayed, maybe he is thinking about how to deliver the news. 
- it feels like a confrontation.
- it's a warning to king nebby
- it should be known your kingdom is heavenly ruled
- it's a warning to break off the sins and practice righteousness.
- must be hard for daniel to share that
- i wonder if king nebby knows it's about him. or else why would he be so afraid.

Cosmic tree also alludes to Towel of Babel Gen 11:4
- which ends in disaster
- nebby would lose his rationality and his power and glory where he behave like wild animals.
  - the one who used to think of himself as a god like figure back in daniel 3
- stump and roots were allow to remain, maybe it means the kingdom and grew back again. 
27
- a jew is wiling to tell a pagan king to confront to moral standard and repentance.
- it means the dreams could have been avoaided.
- if only nebby humbled himself.

28-33
- nebby said "i" buyilt by "my might power" 
- no humbling to god
- the most high removes the kingdom from the king nebby

![king nebby](https://dwellingintheword.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/dan4-nebuchadnezzar-animal.jpg?w=450&h=198)

descriptipon 
- away from people
- ate grass like ox
- body wet
- hair like eatgle's feathers
- nails liek bird's claws

leaves the identity of the king, power, and everything. 
God only leaves him with nothing but himself to take care of.
It must have given nebby a reflection towards what is truly important in life once you stripped away everything.

34-36
nebby learned to humble himself and praise GOd.
nebby doesn't loook at himself, he looks at the heaven with his eyes, and his reson restored. once brought low, God brough him back to the heights, and restored him further. 
- God is able to both humble and proud and to exalt the humble.
- pagan king, destroyer of jerusalem was humbled by GOd's grace, and confess to God's mercy. 

Nebby blesses God.

His kingdom was restored. He is even able to make things greater than what it was. ALl this is by the grace of God. Nebby honors the king of heaven, which is different from what he was before.

8:00 - 8:30 Observe the bible, and ask good questions.
Ask the main bible questions here.

Big questions:

1. How does Nebby's proclamation in 4:1-3 differ from what he said in 3:28-29?

1. As you read nebby's description of the dream, what aspects of it might cause king to be terrified?

1. WHy do you think god intent on impressing nebby wih his absolutely authority instead of grace or love?

1. If Nebby had repented his sins as daniel advised, do you think God woudl have withheld his jdugement? or was his decision irrevocable? Explain.


8:30 - 9:00 small group questions. This is where Gigi has suggested to give people opportunity to ask questions they not yet get from the big group. This is also where the personal question comes in. Something that people can share on a more personal level.

Application

Sometimes we gain fresh insights into God's character as we wrestle with the truth. What des the hard thing about this chapter for you to accept?

What does that hard lesson teach yhou about how GOd works in our lives to bring us into spiritual maturity and Christlikeness?
