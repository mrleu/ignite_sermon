Alex Leu

Some Context
- God can vindicate his faithful servant in front of pagan rulers by giving them unusual wisdom and insight into divine mysteries and miraculously protecting them against hte enmity of their pegan neighbors. 

Outline
1. Drams of King Nubuchadnezzar
2. Dream of Nubuchadnezar's threat
3. Daniel's response
4. Daniel Interprets teh Dreams
5. Nebuchadnezzar promotes Daniel 

vers 1

- Second year. This only happens a year after Daniel 1. This means Daniel and his friends had only been in the school of Nebuchadnezzar for 1 year! Daniel's program is a 3 year thing(Daniel 1), he probaby had not finished his program yet.
- King N is troubled by his dream. It was intense enough that he couldn't sleep at night. He must have felt restless.
- Dreams used to be thought of as a shadow of a future events. King's dream had significance towards the nation as a whole. 

vers 2

- What are these roles?
	1. Magicians(hartumim) 
		- they are dream interpreter and fortune tellers.
		- name harat comes from hebrew, which means someone who posses the power by the means of their writing
		- also appeared in Genesis 41:8, in Exodus 7:11
	1. Echanters are astrologers
	1. Sorceres uses witchcraft, practice sorcery
	1. Chaldeans referred to a part of the babylonian empire. It is a special group who is known for their expertise in magic lore and interpretaing dreams. 

verse 3 - 4 

- King wants to know what the dream mean. Chaldeans seems to be the subject expert to ask the question, as their experience is in the interpretation of dreams
- Notes said that the text switched from Hebrew to Aramaic. It's the court language of the Babylonian settings.	
	
verse 5 - 9 

- King made threat to chaldeans.
- King knows CHaldeans just wanted to buy time. 

verse 10 - 11

- Chaldeans didn't believe anyone could meet king's demand
- this is also a demand that is rare; hardly any king had asked this. 
- Chaldeans emphasized Gods(Babylonians worship multiple Gods) Polytheism 

12 - 14

- death includes all wise men. this includes Daniel and his friends. 
- Daneil was talking to Aroch, who was planning on killing the wisemen -- including daniel!


15 - 21

- Daniel requests some time first. He probably doesn't know what the dream is or what it meant. This is a leap of faith!
- Daneil discussed with his friends, and encourages to talk to God to get revelation. This is prayer!
- Mystery was revealed to Daniel. It was clarified to him through God!
- King sees dreams, Daneil sees vision. Dreams is what you get when you're sleeping, vision is what you get when you're awake. God can do both to communicate to people.
- Daniel asked for time, talked with his friends to pray together, get the revelation, and blessed the lord afterwards. This is how we should think of dealing with problems.
- God reveals truth to his people 

23 - 24
- Daniel asks for wisdom. Daniel receives. Daniel praises God for the revelation of wisdom.
- Daniel wanted to help not just his friends, but also all the other wisemen of Babylon

25 - 30 

- King calls Daniel by his babylonian name :(. Reminded me of how on the outside daniel and his friends have been attempted for conversion
- Daniel gives the interpreation of dream credit to God of Heaven
- Arioch said "I have found". He is claiming credit, but Daniel gave it elsewhere
- reminded me of verse 10. Chaldeans said not a man on earth can meet King's demand, but a person who has the relationship with God can
