Pastor James

## Transition is hard

Leaving from the things you're familar with, however transition is inevitable. Sometimes God brings time in transition to go into transformation. Lyn Cowell. Darkest moment in Pastor James' life with hard breaking, dissappointment, pastor James did not see hope. However, those are the time that Pastor James transformed to who he is today. He is thankful for all these blessing in disguise. We are all in Potter's hand.

Potter's hand. His goal is not to break us, but to mold us to our lord Jesus Christ. Pastor James wanted to share three things that could help us in the state of transition.

## 1. We should have the right mindset.

Jeremiah 29:11. Context before the verse: it came when Babylonian invade Israelites the second time. It was a time of desperation, however this is the moment that God spoke to other people through Jeremiah, that God is still in control. God's though to us is not of evil. Thoughts is to provide *hope and the future*. Still blows Pastor James's like that God has a thoughts in us. God is mindful of us. God's thought of us is in great hope. It is up to us to decide what we think God's thoughts are for us. This is where we ponder in the path of transition. Our God's thought is in peace, and not in evil.

There are scenarios where the fear will come tackle Pastor James. This happens as he is interacting with people in relationships that he cares deeply. If this is not the thought of will of God in our life, why do we want it to try drive our life? To have the right mindset, there are several ways to figure out. Looking into the word of God is one way to **figure it out**. The idea is to differentiate the thoughts -- thinking about whether it's from the word of God or not.

John 10:10 - The thief does not come except to steal, kill and destroy. **I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.** 

2 Timothy 1:7 - "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but **of power and of love and of a sound mind**"

"With out faith it's impossible to please God, because anyoen who comes to himmust **believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnnestly seeking him**." Hebrews 11:6

The question we tend to ask ourselves is why then we suffer all these things.

## 1. Sometimes God want things to have to prune over our lives. John 15:2 shows Jesus cuts off branch that bears no fruit, other times he prune our lives so we can bear even more fruit.
  - Example of ladies cutting hair is an example.
  - God prunes us only for the good.
  - sometimes people won't let God to prune them. This is important.
  
John 16:21. A woamn giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.

We do not want to be rushed in labor. The closer it gets, the more painful it is. All these are done for a reason. The most rejoicing result, because God is providing a new born.

Sometimes God is like a personal trainer.
  - they are pushing you. God is a personal trainer often. He does want to bring the best out for you. God is spotting you.
  
Pastor James was busy at the shikinah glory, then also have the start of training school. The vision sharing night he felt like he was underprepared. He felt underprepared. Pastor James did not feel like he was ready. God was pushing Pastor James' forward. Fly young has retreat after the shikinah, vision casting week, the retreat seems as if it were a piece of cake. 

1. God prune us.
1. God prepare sus
1. God spot us.
  
 No one want to sign Derek Ross. He played his career high(50 points) even after the surgery. The moment they don't see is the moment they are pruning. Speaking also has good moments. believing God to be there for your future, then you will take up the challenges. With out the right mindset, you are just going into misery.
 
##  2. Have the right attitude.

Jeremiah 29:12. The right mindset is so important. if it's wrong, you might even pray to cry out to God. Stress and confusion comes in for transition. Categorization people culture sucks.

When things are not formulated, do not make rash decision. Prayer is the right attitude. It helps you to know that God is in control. It provides you with gratitude. It will help you to run toward God. It helps you to convey your thought to God. When we pray, God listens. And when God listens,  God will react, then we will. Then it will give us a better protocol.

## 3. Have the right goal.

Jeremiah 29:13. After all, our goal is not just to built a glorious church. If this is our goal, then it's not the right goal. The goal is **through all of this, we will find God from it.** Moses did say if God is not going, then he is not going. This is why when Father Abraham(wherever he goes), but bulit altar. In times of transition, we need to have the right mindset/prayer. We need to find God. Only when God is here, that we will find true peace. that's when the tree that we bare that has the tree of life. Finding god in the place of calling. That is the time when the goal is completed. We need to mare sure that God is around. If it were Jesus that had the wrong mindset, it would be hard for him to be the savior.

It is a journey of glory
