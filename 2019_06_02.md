Tough love require tough action. Tough love requires touch discipline.

Proverbs 3

Important for christian to live a victorious life. It's important to realize how much jesus love us.
    - so we can go onto the truth that Jesus loves us.

It's only when you go into a hardship that you ask yourself if Jesus really loves you
- you would have gotten better life if Jesus would have loved you
- satan would lie to you in the middle of your need.

The truth about how jesus loves you and i

No doubt that Jesus loves us and loves us to the end


## Experience Jesus's Love

Mark 14:32-36
- expressing words to explain Jesus's struggle
- Gethsemane - it means repress
- it's a garden of an olive tree
- how long does an olive tree last? They live for more than 2 thousands years
- this is where Jesus went and pray
- he took three people, they are the closest ones he is with.
    - jesus also needs prayer partners

it's a deep deep struggle for Jesus.

When they pray to God, they pray fall face to the ground -- it's gesture of submission

Jesus submit himself to father in heaven

### 1. Jesus chose to obey the Father

Most challenging criss to Jesus's ministry. Whatever decision he makes, will decide the destiny of our lives.

As a read on, it was repeated many times in other books.

Luke 22:43-44.

It's the only time the bible said that Angel came and strengthened him. It's a battle between his will and the Father's will.

When in anguished, he prayed more anguishly.
    - it's because he was in anguish that his blood cell even burst.

Jesus's suffering before he was on the cross. he is already suffering. It's the first time Jesus addresses God as "Abba Father."

None of the Jewish people dared to call their God Father. Jesus's cried out is like a boy going to the father to ask for help.
- Jesus had a great relationship with the father.

It's considered as a bitter cup. His blood will be shed on the cross.

Matthew 26:43-44

Jesus found the people sleeping afterwards. People were really tired, and by having to be awake he puts on the tape on his eyes to know that he is awake. Jesus left them, and repeated the same stuff multiple times afterwards

Knowing it's going to be a bitter cup, yet he is willing to do so.

### 2. Jesus laid down his life willingly

They arrest Jesus, and Peter tried to slice people off.
Matthews 26:52-54

Jesus said to peter, "Thanks, but no thanks."

Legion of angels - 1 legion is 6k soldiers. Jesus said he doesn't need peter. he could have called out the father to summon angels. Jesus heard his prayer. 12 Legions of angel

It shows how much the father loves the son. Father gave Jesus so much angels to use at his disposals. Jesus did not call in Father's temple.

After his arrest, the cheif priest tries to condemn Jesus to death, but has no authority. They then need to bring it to pilate

Chief priest accused Jesus many things. Pilate has questioned Jesus thoroughly, and knows that he is innocent. Pilate knows Jesus is innocent

Even when Pilate's wife had a dream that knows the Pilate is innocent.

The real innocent one -- Jesus -- did not make one plead with his life. Pilate was crying out loud -- telling Jesus that he could have pardoned Jesus.

John 10:18

Jesus had decided to laid it down to take command from his own father. If he does not want to be arrested, no one could have caught him. it was a willingly decision to do so.

Death on the cross is one of the most inhuman way of dying.

Jesus took all the sufferings, and do not compare to his last suffering.

Mark 15:33-34

From noon to 3 PM. the Darkness had came over to the world. Greatest pain Jesus had ever suffered.

Deep down emotional/psychological pain comes in at 3 PM.

Jesus was never once removed from his father, only at this part.

Jesus took out all his energy to cry out his pain. They put it in the original language. Jesus spoke in greek, however at that time Jesus spoke in aramaic. HE couldn't even express it in greek. he needs to express it in his own mother tongue.

He switched his addresement from Abba to My God. IT's like calling your dad Mr.

It's so distant and so formal. All he sees was upon him. He was totally righteous but got into unrighteous

That's when God needs to turn away from his son. It must be dreadful and terrible. It's our sins that cost Jesus to separate from the father


### 3. Jesus suffered the pain of separation from the father.

Psalm 22:1.

Jesus bore all our iniquities.

Isaiah 53:6

It's not jesus that was hung there, it was our iniquities for our sin.

Why does Jesus do all these things? it's because Jesus loves us to the end. The time had come for people to leave.

John 13:1

Jesus loves us to the end -- never astray

His love was the very end -- never at once Jesus was to change his mind.

When you go to trials and temptation -- remember that Jesus had died on the cross. he chose to died and separation from the heavenly father all because he loves us to teh end.
