# Learn three things from mothers.

Three Facts about Mom

1. Mothers never stops nagging.
1. Moms are experts to white lies.
1. Moms are the go to person for everything

We always talked about Father's heart, but we never heard of mother's heart.
Heavenly father really have the character of father and mother.

When we talk about father's love, there's definitely good things from the mother.

## 3 things to learn from MOm

1. Sacrificial Love

Mothers sacrifices way more than dad.
Daily routine doesn't get any recognition.
Moms are true servants.

Mark 10:45. Jesus said the son of man came not to be served, but to serve others.

How does mom do non-stop and do these service daily, and willingly
Mom serves selflessly.
To be a great leader, you need to be a great servant.

Son has to be faithful. All the moms have the faithful quality.
Christ Jesus is an amazing example for a faithful servant

Pastor James had gone to africa to awhile.
There are sad stories behind the big momas. Big momas really carried the family. They were the faithful ones.
They are cross cultural, international.

Christ loves you in a sacrificial love.

2. Second Chance

Mom gives second chance, another word is forgiveness. No matter how much we messed up, mothers always forgive.
Potty training third kid, and is not easy.
He is very impressed that his wife has a huge patient in potty training the daughter.
Not mater how messy it is, God always gives us the second chance.
Blood washed away means God fogive us about our sins.

God really washed away our sins -- even if you messed up this morning.

Lamentation 3:21-23
His mercy is new every morning.
1 John 1:9. God is faithful to just forgive us for our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
If jesus did not give Peter the second chance, his job would be 95% complete. THe discipleship program of Christ would have failed.
Praticing second chance would be the beginning of the amazing breakthrough.

3. Surrender

We see a lot in worship. All the points were mentioned in the worship.

It's easy to pronounce, but very hard to put into practice.
When a couple are expecting a new born, father is able to reprogram. Mother has nowhere to do so. she needs to surrender herself to adjust herself to the chemicals.
Kids are not like basketball.

Pastor James always let his wife win when they have quarrels.

How does christ surender himself to come to the world.
WHen you know how much moms do to surrender, it humbles pastor james.
it's the secret to true success. it's only when you surrendered your own plan, that is when you can obey and enter the will and plan of God.
Only when you surrender, you are able to enter the planet God has for you.
Surrender is hard -- you need to be selfless, and give control to others.
Abraham was surrendering when he leave his house.

Surrender is the key to enter your destiny. If Christ did not surrender himself.

Phillipeans 2:7-9

True obedience is the true win win for every one. if you don't surrender, you are not winning. 

Phillipeans 2:9

Jesus gave up everything. He needs to give up everything for him to be exalted to the highest place.
