## Pastor Jason

Someone came up to him about the vision to the group:

**Group has a whirlwind. God is at the center of the whirlwind. People are linking hands, and as more people join it gets bigger and bigger. Pointing and funneling more people towards God.**

He wants another go at the same topic. He wants to preach about unity. THere's more people, more wave and momentum in ignite. WIth out unity, this momentum would be short waved. All of us need to be united, together. It means we are all together in this goal proclaiming the gospel.

Repeating from last time, but adds an extra spin. preached about 1 Corithn 13

Church was dividing up puffing by knowledge and which teacher they are following. Division of the church

Sign of an immature Christian:

1. Causes disunity with others
1. Puffs up oneself in knowledge

Paul's Responses

1. God is the one who makes you grow
1. God will be the judge
1. Godly wisdom is different than wordly wisdom
1. Godly wisdom brings unity among Christians.

Ultimately find that God is the one that grows a person's spiritual walk.

Preachers all over are all on the same team. Even though they all contradicts one another, 
- the only way through faith in Jesus Christ that we shall not perished and have an eternal life.

Seminary is very conservative. Professors jokingly ask no one listens to the charismatic pastor.
Different ministers minister to different person at different time.
He will read different things, but he gets ministered at different times.

Something ZPJ watched recently. Elevation church.

Two interviews:

TBJ shares the highs and lows of the ministry. Famous pastors all go through suffering to get to where they're at. He shared about the struggled that he had when he first preaching. He is not preaching for material wealth or fame. It's through the tough times that God builds character, so that when he became famous, he had the spiritual foundation to keep on going.

How the christ of ministry really had caused him everything. ZPJ now understands more and more what these people are talking about. These pastors are speaking to him. Maybe through other seasons, these ministers will be seasoned to ZPJ.

We dont use these ministers to puff those people up.

ZPJ sometimes play basketballs with out pastors and conservative church. Ultimate goal is to build unity in churches with other people.

**Different seasons/different minister to different people**

### Story

ZPJ goes to grad school at cal poly slo. the guy he went to carpool with, always questioned his theology movement. few years ago he started to see this person at ROLCC. he was questioning what happened to the conservativeness. He said at ROLCC, people welcomed him, and loved him, and gave him opportunity to serve. At other places the person was avoiding them. THen he was revealed that he just repeated the things that other people had told him.

Now he is a very activce member, so it always revealed to zpj that GOd moves in mysterious way.

There's a clash between jewish/gentile christian. Biblical corith that combines two bodies of land together. It's a strategic location.

Paul writes his responses to the church of hte corith
    - not a specific teacher that leads to a growth of a person.

1 Corinth 3:18-23

Wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's wisdom
    - God's wisdom supercedes worldy wisdom

We should all *boast about GOd* *we are all servants to God*.

All of this is for God.


#### What does Godly wisdom look like?

- differentiate it from knowledge and wisdom.

Knowledge vs. wisdom
Knwledge is accumulation of facts and information
    - you might know a lot, but don't know how to apply it to life.

The world has their own definition of success.
    - it also applies knowledge differently.

Paul contrasts wordly/godly wisdom.

1 Corith 26:27.
Humans knowledge look at how influential you were, wise by human standard. 

Christians brought their own standard for success to church, however Paul says that's not how we defined wisdom to the church.

We then also look at people's family background to define succcess.
    - we put value in school
    - what do we look at?
    - networth
    - how many instagram you have on instagram

People look at the wisdom for the wordly.

"what or who do you see as stupid right now?" maybe god is showing that we are not quite as smart/wise than we are.

God looks on the inside.

1 Samuel 16:7. The lord looks at the heart

### Why mention this at ignite?

Unity on the church. w.o unity, we can not grow. won't last long until we are united. ZPJ gets more conviction to preach about unity.

Disunity at church:
    1. someone thinks they are smarter/better/wiser than other people. they bring their own definition success to church.

_Maybe_ you think you want to be a worship leader/cell leader.

**Do you reflect godly character?**

God looks at the heart. If you have to choose between two qualified candidates. He recommends people choosing someone with the Godly character.

God's wisdom supercedes human wisdom. As we continue to move forward to ignite.

Sometimes things in ignite don't make sense to you and I. yet we still choose to follow in God, and know that we are in the mission to build a glorious church.

### Story ZPJ had when he thinks he is too boastful

God uses the congregation to open up biblical truth.

When ignite first started, he was the only YAPPY. Mostly from communmity college or SJSU.

He knew one day the people would have been yappies.

Needs two people. *does not know how transition to group of young professionals*

He has a *wrong concept* that the school goes to determines the success. He knew people who went to local community colleges. he does now know how to be young professionals.

It was magnified by the culture they were in.

One day she shared that she got a nursing job at standford medical center, one of the best hospital. He congratulatd the person, but God is also revealed and answered his doubts of his false wisdom. 

Another one someone else went to sjsu, ended up getting a job at Google. God created new fields of these people. Two people who went to SJSU that grew up here in ignite, and got more prestigious jobs.

A lot better than other schools. Ignite is mostly young professionals. God changes the demographic of this group. He had a divine plan. Worldy lie that which school you go to determines what job you'd get.

God's way is higher than his own way.

He now look at someone on the outside, he does not look at someone from the outside. He sees what is on the inside. He now gets a big perspective in how he feel amazes on how people woudl do to them.
