WHen you feel down, just look at the shikinah glorty
- shows how our god is faithful
- take the impossible to possible.

God is taking us to the new season
    - there is new annointing.

## How do we prepare in this new season of God.

### 1. Activate your prayer life.
- channel where we can experience the power of God.
- not fighting a physical battle, but a spiritual one. Ephesian 6.
    - pray in teh spirit on all occations with all kind of requests.
a. **pray in the spirit**

Paul said Holy Spirit is helping our weakness. We do not know what to pray.
In the bottom of our heart, we still don't know how to pray. We don't know
what God wants us to do. Holy spirit come is to help in our weakness.
It wil pray for us. **When you pray, you are actually not alone.**

When you pray, the holy spirit is actually with you. Actually praying with
you at the same time. *you are not alone*. The holy spirit understands the
word of God. The Holy spirit prays for you under God's will. Holy spirit
is praying for you at the same time. There is no need to rush into prayer to
the spirit.

We rush to God to many things. Holy spirit is always praying with you and for
for you in according God's will.

You should stay a little longer, quiet down, and listen. Allow the holy spirit
to guide your mind. So you understand what hte holy spirit is praying.

WHen you undrestand what hte Holy Spirit is praying, then your prayer will sure
be answered!! Halleluyah.

When you're praying, you're not just talking with God -- allow it to move as you
guide your mind.

b. **pray on all occations**

You can pray anywhere, and anytime. Pastor Tong likes to pray when he is driving
During the rush hour it would be a great time to pray.

Traffic is **God giving devotion time** You can spend time with God. You can
put anytime to pray. The cubicle becomes his prayer closet as you turn around
and pray. No matter where you are, pray. 

c. **keep on praying**.

We all understand the power of prayer, but we don't continue to pray. Jesus
took 3 desciples to pray, but the three people all fell asleep. When Jesus
found out all fell asleep, Jesus asks if they can all stand for one hour.
They even don't know how to respond to Jesus. THey are still sleeping.

Mark 14:41. Jesus said "Enough" for sleeping. It's not a time to sleep,
it's time to wake up and pray. Praying is not a time to sleep. It's a time
to rise up and pray. It's so important -- that if you don't pray, you
don't understand the timing of God.

It's time to spiritual battle, it's never physical. Peter thought it was
itme to fight, but it was mistaken. That's why Peter always does the wrong
thing. The secret of your success is to do the right hting at the right time.

THe *season of time is important*. There's a time in your life. You have to
understand God's time in your prayer. So you can do the right thing in the
right time.

## II. Rise up and co-labor with God!!

Even though we have an almighty God, he still chooses to work with us. God
still chooses to work with us, as perfec as God.

Luke 10:2. Jesus teaches desicples to pray. It's to send the workers. Workers
was thought to be missionaries and pastors. The more Pastor tong learned about,
it, it's not limited to missionaries. It's whoever who want to co-labor iwth GOd
To bring GOd's soluiton to the situation. This workers can be multiple things.

You're the children of God. You're the children of God.

John 1:12. Give the right to become the children of God. God gives you the right
and authority to be the children of God.

God gives you the right, the authority to be the children of God.

What kind of authority? Matthew 18:18. We are called to bring God's solution to 
our situation. Every person God uses is very oridinary.

1. Moses.
1. David -- even forgtten by his father.
1. Peter -- he denied Jesus 3 times.

THey are all very ordinary. They did not run away. THey took the opp and take it
by faith. Dvaid did not run away when battled Goliath.

When Peter sees the crowd of pentacost. He did not run away. He stood up, and 
took the opportunity to preach to the Gospel. Paul, he had the voice. He did not
run away. He took teh opportunity. He then preached to the entire world. God 
always take the opportunity in front of you. Take the opportunity, and take
forth by faith. 

What God can do in our life is always beyond our *own imaginations.*

Pastor Tong never realized he'll go to Africa. The effect are aall done because
we have a great almighty God.

## III. Hunger for more annointing.

We can't rely our own wisdom and strength. We need more annoiting from God.
Elisha understands this issues so well. He know that his teacher is going to
take him to God. It's so important for the annointing. It's the annoitning
among the Elijah that has brought forth the following of Elisha. He follows
until he redceives the annointing.

Isn't the double portion is a bit greedy? But then Elijah said only GOd can 
give it. If he had seen Elijah has been taken by the heaven, then he can
get the double portion. It's his hunger/more annoiting. You got to receive that
annoiting. we have to have teh spirit of elijah. more and more hungfer to our
lives. ONly annoiting gives us power for us to serve. We need to come
before lord, and open our mouth wide so Jesus can fill us. If we open our mouth
small, God fills us small. God's spiritual principle is so simple. God will
greatly fill you.

You need the hunger, and annointing from God. We are entering the new season
of God. God will give new annointing.

HOwever hte new year it's going to be double portiion annoiting. Annoiting of
*expansions and upgrade* We are entering the new season
of God. God will give new annointing. In 1.5 years, there's berak through 
and annoiting. 

HOwever hte new year it's going to be double portiion annoiting. Annoiting of
*expansions and upgrade*

God will increase in family life, personal life, ministry. We always new things.

You should ask the questions have you ever done something to God. Hitting the
new territory for God. In the new season, it's the season of expansion. 
Whenever you step our by faith, God will give the land to you like the JOshua. 
God will give you will the land is set upon.

THe expansion is happening!!

WHen things happen you know. Praise the Lord. We got parking expansion and
upgrade!

God will give you access and keys that yo ucouldn't open up before. In a new
season of God, God is giving us double portion. Things will happen.

In the coming years. No matter what happened, Pastor alays think like Joshua to
cross the Jordan RIver. THere are so many fears and doubt beofre him, HOwever,
God still gives them assurance, and akss JOhusa to be strong and courageious.

No matter what happened, that's all in teh past of the wilderness. Even though
there's uncertainty, there's still strong strength and courageous. WHen God is
with us, he will sure to provide.
