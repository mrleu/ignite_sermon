Communication is the key to have happy marriage, healthy relationship.
- complex things
- hard to master the art of communication.

Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to be angry. Sometimes people don't get it even if you wrote it down clearly.

New season, God has given us a new annointing.

New Annointing: **Expansion and Upgrade/Elevation**

We need to think how can we experience it in our work/life. We all want to be promoted in work and ministry. 

We will be looking at the interesting event in the gospel -- how Jesus transformed in front of the disciples.

Mark 9:2-8

2-3: it's important to know what had happened before the 6 days.

In chapter 8, it's when Jesus asked Peter who he is.
    - son of God, the Messiah.
He only took 3 disicples to go with him: Peter, James, John
- be transformed in the mental of your mind.
Jesus transfigured before them. Jesus took the disciples to high mountain, and take them away from they usually were. They wanted to bring them to a different manner. They have never seen Jesus in this manner before. This is the very glorious form. The secret to elevation, we first need to follow jesus to the *mountain*.

Leave the comfort zone, for Jesus to take us where he wants to meet us. THey need to leave at 12 to see jesus in teh glorious form. Determination and Preseverence is required to hike the mountain. Pasotr had high school friends that love to hike. THey all hiked to mt. fuji.

It was the highest mountain in region of galilee. It's mount hermon. 9234 feet. Mount hermon magaic. It takes 5 hours to go up 2k feet. It takes at least 10 hours fo them to get to mount hermon. Jesus led them to mount hermon, so jesus can show them who he really is.

we really need to leave our comofort zone to see Jesus glowing.

Mathew 17:2 - his face shown like the son, and his clohtes became as white as the light. This is really Jesus glowing. THey know jesus, but they don't really know who he was at the time. There are too many distration down the plain, so they can take them up to see Jesus's glory. 

Our human eyes can't hold the glory of God. No one can see the glory of God. It takes a price to go up to the mountain. It takes preserverence -- a place that we can meet God in place to place.

March ch 9:1, some will not taste death until they see kingdom of God come with power. How god manifest his power. There is a higher ground that GOd wants us to go. You may have to *leave the twelve to see the one that has the glory* 

I. Follow Jesus up the mountain
    A. Determination and preseverence
    B. Have a glimpse of Jesus's glory

Moses and Elijah were with Jesus. WHy were they with Jesus.

Luke 9:30-31 - they spoke about Jesus's departure of the cross, which was going to be fulfilled @ Jerusalem.
Jesus departure is so important that they sent them Moses and Elijah. Death on a cross is no ordinary death.

Moses - he's the one who can see God face to face to bring GOd's command to the people.
Elijah - greatest prophet in the old testatment. He represents the prophets.

Together they come and tell Jesus the fulfillment.

Jesus Transfigured in front of them, and finally he was crucified on the cross.

We need to find 1. OUR OWN MOUNTAIN. leave our comfort zone. Ask God taht you're ready to see his glority. 

II. Listen to Jesus
    A. Be quiet and shut up.

Mark 9:5-6.

WHen he sees something so wonder, and peter still tries to hold onto Jesus by making him a shelter. Jesus said Peter ahd already forgotten that Jesus was to suffer on the cross.

Rabbi it was good for us to be here. 

Peter made a big mistakes again
    - Jesus is the son of God. Peter did not know what to say, because he was so frightened.

Bright cloud starts speaking after Peter. This is God's way to say shut up and listen to Jesus. Keep quiet when you're in the presence of God. Can't said anything that makes sense. Listen to Jesus. It's the direct command from Father the GOd to Peter.

This is only teh second time God had to break through the crowd and speak trhough people. The first time was the baptism of Jesus Christ through the holy spirit.

We usually listen to people instead of listening to Jesus. THat's our problem most of the time. When we seek for direction, instead of looking of jesus, we look for people/Google.

However Santan is here to **steak, kill, and destroy**

We really need to pay attention to him in the new season. We really ned to spend time to go into the mountain/go into the place where we can have quiet time to enjoy the presence fo God.

All the gang said they would now fall away. Mark ch 14:30-31, Jesus then called out Peter again.

IF Peter were to take note and listen to Jesus, then he could have understood Jesus that he needs to stand firm in his weakness.

If you were told taht you would disown jesus three times, it's best to listen and asks for forgiveness.

When you choose God's way, you then realize that God's way is always better than your way. It's good to listen to him. We really need to pay attention and listne to Jesus vey very clearly.

It might take times and effort/or even price to leave comfort zone to wail upon the world.

III. See no one, only Jesus.
    A. Maturity is hwne you see no one, only Jesus.
    B. How to see no one, but only Jesus
        1. Praise and worship
        2. Devotion and Prayer
        3. Daily Living and Serving

Mark 9:8. Afterwards, they don't see anyone but Jesus. Important to see hero of faith, but God doesn't want us to lose focus for hte son of God himself.

Scholar debate how people recognize Moses and Elijah. THey don't know, but peter knew.

Moses and Elijah will be gone, but teh son of GOd will always be there.

They all have a common trait. 12 - let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the *author and perfector of our faith*

Let us fix our eyes on Jesus. He's the alpha and the omega.

If face_our_eyes_to_circiumstance:
    failture
if face_Jesus
    joy set before by enduring the cross.

Who is the focus of the worship? see nonoe, and only Jesus.
- only focus on the author and the protector of our christ.

Ask to open your eyes to only see Jesus.

Here to worship is all about Jesus.

Newcomers would come in, and pastor would share about visions.
    - many new comers come into the middle of worship, tears starts falling down.
    - it's the touch of God.

SOmetimes we lose the freshness that God touch us today. Ask Jesus to help led us see them

Ask God to know what is *your desire* 
speak to us as we read the word.

In our prayer time too. We wanted something form God. THe focus should not be on ourselvess.
- lord, i'm here. led your will be done in my life.
- may your kingdom come to our live.
- we need to practice it on a daily basis.


We are so concered what other people think of US.

But when we start to shift our focus to jesus:
    - Colossian 3 verse 33 - you're the only one we're serving.

God then becomes tangible in our live.
