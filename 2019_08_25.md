## Don't Complain

## Don't focus on your enemy, but meditate on God
Enemy with make you focus on your problem
Enemey will then come and lure your way
Learn to focus on God -- meditate on God's attribute, what he does and what he will do

So you can pull yourself away from the enemy and think about How great God is, and what God can do to you
Enemey tries to take us away from the plan of God -- to fulfill our plan in God's lives. These are the thing that GOd will not be pleased.
Mediate on God, and present yourself to God.


when everyone around us do the wrong things, have the prayer to go into the righteousness. 

### Hand your enemies to God.
When you try to fight your enemey in your ways, you'd complain and get discouraged.
Bring it before to the lord, bring it to God.

WHen people complain as Moses lead people to the promise land. God said they are not rejecting you, they are rejecting me.
DOn't repay anyone evil with evil. Do what is right in the eyes of everybody.

## Bring God
## Expect God to answer your prayer

Psalms 5:3
When you come to the Lord, and be anxious to God.

Psalms 5:4-6
Your destroy those who tell lies.
7 things that lord does not like. God does not take pleasure from evil.

Psalms 5:7-8
[ Psalms ] 5:9-10
