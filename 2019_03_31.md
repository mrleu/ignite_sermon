## Submitting to Authority
You probably have issues with it if you're triggered by the subject.

Why?

Our generation has a reputation for struggling with it. We have negative connotation to submitting authority.
Media and academics may be the cause for it. It is also caused by bad experiences from the leaders.
It's hard for us to know.

Fun fact!
Technically Ignite is multi-generations.

First, this is a biblical concept. It is also found throughout the bible. We are going to look for places where people submit authority.

## Genesis 2:15-17
"commanded" - demand/order.
The lord gave command for the man to do in the very early creation.

## Exodus 20:1-17
God then gave Israelite 10 commandments to follow.
Eight of those commandments are "Thou shall not"
    - You shall not statements
    - do this type of statements

## Jesus
When it comes to Jesus, John 6-:38-40
*I have come down from heaven not to do y will but do the will of him who sent me*

**Eternal Life**

## Apostles writing letters on how to rely on authority.

There are interaction with christians and non-christian leaders.

## Christian Leader Hebrews 13:17-18
**Submit to their authority and pray for us**

## None Christian Leaders Romans 13:1-2

## 1st Timonthy 2:1-3
**prayers, live peaceful and quiet lives**

Submitting to authority is not a new concept. It is continued to be repeatd through out to the new testament. 

Why submitting to authority?

**You Will Have Life**

If adam and eve followed through, they would have had a good life to Eden.

Working for corporate america is not easy, it's stressful.

If the people followed the commandments, they would have stayed at the promise land. They were exiled afterwards. 

Israel is fresh, and Jordan is a desert. Middle East most place is desert, and one piece of land is nice, and that's Israel.

### Jesus

He is able to redeem man kind. With out Jesus, we would not be going to Heaven.

We would of had eternal life with Jesus. People usually want to have good life.

Hebrews, it says to pray for the king and authority.

**Even though we know it, why is it still so difficult for us to do?**

## This is why in ZPJ stand point.

1. Enemy wants to stop it.
    - He smears it, and have negative connotation to that word.
    - Student level you call them teacher's pet. In corporate you call it brown nosing.
    - Connotation that it's a bad thing to have favor with the authority.

A lot of us don't seek out for that favor. We are afraid to be labelled for these labels. We don't even puruse it.

Story about GSW.
    - they were not good team back in the day.
    - Mark Jackson does not submit the authority.
    - Steve Kerr is very good relationship with the owners.


Another type of Managements

Managing up. Managing the people that is above you. You then give the right expectation to the right goals.

Because the *enemy* knows it, they will make ways to stop the submittion of the authority.

1. Our Sin Nature

We are fallen people, and it's our sinful nature to not follow authority. 
    We naturally gravitate to murder/steal people.
    Lord has to tell us to specifically to not do it.
    If we leave to our own self, we wouldn't do all these things.

Which is why God explicitely tells us to do these things.

This is why it's so *hard* to submit these things.

1. Bad Examples.

First form of bad authority is our parents.
Parents have big influence on how you turned out -- regardless it was good or bad.
Workshop, pastor belinda acknowledges the fact. She tells us to forgive our parents. Parents need to forgive the children.

ZPJ feels like he was watching healing in real time. Parents ask for forgiveness on the behalf of parents.

It was also their first time parenting. Grew up in the different cultures, and tried to put the previous culture to the american culture.
We then project it to our parent relationship. It leads us all to be skpetical.

*Things are not always black and white.*

Real time healing.

1. Looks like failure

Sometimes submitting authority feels like a failure. The leaders have bird eyes view. They would thing its stupid when they have a limited perspective/view. Sometimes people form above tells you to do things, and it doesn't make sense.

It doesn't make sense because we don't have a birds eye view of the situation.

Jesus Chris died on the cross. People were mocking Jesus when he died, "You can save others, but you couldn't even save yourself."

This whole time Jesus was *submitting to the father*

God has a bird's eye view of the entire situation.

It's because they see the big picture.

Faith is where *you don't know the result, but you trust the Lord*

### What about these off time example.

ZPJ said it's outlier. This situation, you should probably bounce.
Home, church, and work - our social life.

ZPJ didn't feel frustrated at home, so he lived here until now,

Church - if you complain a lot, and don't see yourself being here long term

ZPJ didn't want people feel like they are forced to be here. It maybe something God is convicting you of to keep going church.

If it's not God's conviction, then ZPJ does not want you to suffer. As long as their walk with the lord is better, than 

#### when you start to complain about. 

If you see bouncing enough, but it was complaining a lot. Not to be a grumbler.

## How does it reflect to us?

Things that are reflected to ZPJ. We would expereince on day.

Sharing of ZPJ's problem with people @ church.

### ZPJ testimony

Great youth program. 15 years here have different pastors. Always feel like the pastor is going to lead soon.

He would then have hard will for the leaders. Something must be wrong, because why pastors kept on getting changed.

Then he realized he had bad time towards leadership.

Leaders get more praise/credit than they deserve -- also more blames
- all the bad things he kept on getting more blamed than he deserved.

2014 he took a break from ROL. He had to learn how to submit to authority. Go with where the river flows, and not go through the pure upstream. 

Had to understand and accept it.

How does ZPJ understands it? By praying for them whole heartedly.
- he asked God to teach him how to understand people.
- what drives people is what people loves.

The person he loves the most is his brother.
- playing basketball reminds him of his father.
- he still thought it was worth it because it made him brother happy.

He is now able to submit authority. Decision making is not as black and white.

Once he was able to submit it wholy, he was able to come back.


### He was conflicting with the seminary degree.

Senior leader to get the seminary degree. It wasn't conventional knowledge. He always ask him about the seminary degree.
He hasn't changed his mind. he will submit it to the leadership. Lord will give him more light.
Trust that Lord will give him more light.
End on a note to pray for our churhc leaders.
