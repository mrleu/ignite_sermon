## Temptation of Jesus

How we can apply these spiritual application to our lives.
It will ead to ZPJ testimony, and hopefully become encouragement.

Matthews 4:1-11

## 1. Jesus tempted by the devil.

Men should not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from God.

It's before Jesus started his ministry.

- Devil likes to stop us before we even start.

Author of Mathews -- right before the temptation of Jesus, it talks about
the baptism of Jesus.

When we want to start our ministry, devil stops us before we start.

Ministry may not be in the four walls of our church. Whatever your ministry is, the devil will try to stop you before you even started.

Movie Reference: Terminator.

Every Teminator movie, there was a terminator sent back in time to kill John Connor.

Devil tries to stop our ministry before we even started. Imagine the God shows you the plan, but there's another plan that had stopped you. 

### 2. Devil challenges our identity in christ

- Devil said "if". He wants Jesus to prove that he is.
- often when we do our ministries, devil do challenge our identities.
    - movie reference(there's always an identity crisis in the superhero.)
    - Dark Knight Reference.

Villains know that they are going to lose. Heroes always end up winning. only way to win is for the hero to defeat in themselves.
The lord has already told you, and given you the destiny. God has already planned it. THe only thing that stops you is yourself.

### 3. He provides you with shortcuts
     Devil said to compromise your mission, and he will give you award. People would present to you short cuts. There's the faster route, but you know in your heart that it's not the right thing to do. 


### How can we stop the Devil from influencing of our ministry.

 - YOu need to know the word of God.
 - verse 6, the devil even quote scripture, but quotes incorrectly.
 - place your identity in Christ.
    - anyone that is in christ is in a new creation.
    - when we get baptized, we get new creation/identity.
    - after walking with the lord for awhile, you couldn't imagine the things you've done in the past.
    - self realization of how different we are before we knew GOd.

- Romans 8:28
    - There are situations your love of God slowly diminishes.
    - if we get our negatives, it will get us down.
    - if we choose to love God and pursue God, God will make it work.
    
1. Know the word of God
1. Place our identiy in CHrist
1. Trust the process.

This will be Pastor Jason's testimony.

Revelations 12:11.
