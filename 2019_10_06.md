# Ignite Ministry

## October 20 Mission Month Combined Service.

### What God is doing in Asia - buliding glorious church.

Met ROLCC in year 2000.
- Spiritual Family in Christ.

Come to Mongolia.

Frances went to Mongolia 10 years ago.

### Book of Matthew 16:18
- Jesus Christ talking about Church.

First time in the Bible he uses the word "church"
    - this greek word. (Ekelsia?)
        - meaning the group of people.

Jesus said he will build his church.
    - church belongs to God.

All around the world there's lots of expansion of church

This church belongs to God. If you become part of the church, you become part of the body of Christ.

Jesus will build his church.
    - wonderful promise that God gave to his people

He will build from firm foundation.
    - gates of Hades shall not open.

Church is not a building, it's about the people.
    - people who believe only salvation came from Jesus Christ.

In Mongolia there'se lots of korean missionary
    - they start church, preach gospel.
    - korean missionaries always talka botu the bulilding.
        - if there's no building, it's not real church.

Doesn't agree. Church is not building, it's people who place their faith in God.
- Not to have a nice building, it's to make disciples for Jesus Christ.

We need to be the living example for God's church.

THere are three things we must do:

#### Have faith
    Matthew 15-16, the son of living is Jesus CHrist.

Out of faith can overcome this world.
    - 1 John 5
    - God want us to have faith in it.

If you want to have a strong word of faith, then spend more time with God.

you can have faith listening to sermon, but it's not enough to be growing your faith.
    - there are better way to grow your faith
        - it's to have personal relationship with God.
        - experience who he is through his word, through the holy spirit.
        - then your faith is growing.

With out faith, you're impossible to please God.

If you don't have faith, all those things are nothing. Only thing that matters to God is _faith_

You should make a __decision__ to have a relationship with God.

Romans 10:17 - Faith comes from hearing of the word of God.

By faith, we can do everything.

Believe his word to be obedient in his word. Believe in Jesus is not enough, because even devil believes in Jesus.
The devils shaking when they think of Jesus.

Sometimes we think that God should serve our best interest, where we ask God to make a way.

DId not tell God to have simple life. God asks us ot be royals.

There is no excuse for us.

Once we believe in him, there's no more option, we would need to follow him and be obedient in his word.

You must have believe that he creates the universe. be grateful for him. He is creator.

It's because of GOd that you are here.

Doesn't matter how you like it or not. You'r ehere becaues of GOd. it's GOds' wish.

God never asked the pastor where he wanted to be born. He would have chosen U.S. God never asked the pastor for his opinion to be Mongolian.

Before he became a christian, he hated being mogolian. There's no future. Everything is dis-ordered.
Many teachers quit their job to become businessman.
THere are lots of young people that became thugs/robbers. He was one of the thugs/robbers.

He believed there's no future in Mongolia. he wanted to go to europe or u.s

God then touched his heart. First time he came to lord was when he was 18. Afterward he really wants to follow God's command.

He then cried genuienly to his country. He believd that God has created him as Mongolian to have a reason. He then received the call to become the pastor. There are only 5 pastors, and they prophecy that he would become pastor. Missionary gives him will to become pastor leader.

Whne he went to bible school, he didn't have dream too become pastor. he went to russia so he can leave mongolia. God said he created the pastor for mongolia. he gave him calling to be shepherd of his sheep.

Only then he belive that GOd has a plan in his life. he believe every single oen of us have a plan fro GOd.k

GOd has a reason for his life. It's bigger than that. Having a godo family is a good thing, but GOd's vision is bigger than your family.

It asks to preach the gospel and save the lost soul.

You faith is not just existed for God.

Jeuss is your lord. you should serve him to live by all your strength by his words.

Make disciples. Bible doesn't say we should hide behind church walls. BIble says nothing will stop us. Nothing can stop us. He courages us to be brave to preach about the Gospel. Nothing can stop you. You will see God's miracle in your life. God u=gave us GOd's creations.
Be GOd's witness. It has already happened. we are already empowered by the holy spirit. now we need to act. go forward, and preach the gospel.

When we look at business. when you expand, you provide more job. church grows because it has good disciples. Now how big. not enough, there's the bigger goal to bring disicples of all nations. encourage us to be good dsicples of christ.

### Protect unity of the church
- have faith
- make disciples
- protect unity

Jesus says "my church""

Jesus always prayed for us to be one.
every 1 of us who belongs to church belongs to Christ.

Jesus is the head ot eh church.
    - some people says they love Jesus, but then they don't love their neighbors.

mongolias people say they gave their life to Jesus, but they hate their the non-believers.

When we see the person
