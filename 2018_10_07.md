### Pastor Kevin Lee

Curious about the why -- why we are doing things.
Pastor that Jason used to go to when he went to Davis.

# There is no win in comparision

Background
- grew up in taiwan, went to cupertino high.
- knew Pastor Tung in high school.
- Pastor James 10/20 years ago too.

Coming here is like coming home.

- Used to do sports. When he came to the U.S, he wanted to try out for the baseball team. He then
  gave up on baseball, because people are huge.
- Decides to do Math, because he was trained. Then he hated people that got into Stanford/Berkely.
- Talking about College -- how it gets graded by a Gaussian Curve.
  - His Hong Kong Friends do not need the bell curve.
- After becoming Pastor, he thought he no longer gets compares, but then he then started to get ask
  about how many church people his church has.
- Poor Memorization, and can't memorize anything.
- Has two kids -- 12 and 9.
- We do have a natural Tendency to compare ourselves.
  - It's because we all live in the land of "er"
  - You then started to hint for things.
- We then "lie" to ourselves.
  - We say want them the full potential(blah).
  - When we see our kids, we started comparing our kids with others.
  - Secretly, people love it when others failed. :(  

Other side of it.

You then see others who less competant. Then people start to feel more "superior."
Another group felt the "est" more than the "er": always wanted the *best*. We constantly
finding ourselves in comparision.

- Some of us have realization that they will never be like *them*: more of a self realization of
  insecurity and self doubt.
  
The trap is here.

There is need a final line where you feel like you have reached it. There is always something
*better*. Some people drive their spouse crazy to ask them to be something that they are not.
Some people hate the relative party, because there's the whole component of comparision that
exists.

Gospel:

### The reason why Jesus was put to the cross is because Pharisee are jealous of him.

THe Pharisees could never have the crown.

**Our Comparision has the potential has the begin to *hurt* the people around us.**

**Envy rots the bone**
- There is no win in comparision.
- What do we do as Christians?
  - We tent to go to scripture for answers.
  - Pastor wanted to give others who are not christians a permission to read the bible.
- He wants to see if we can get some help when we compare ourselves to the people of left and right.

## Ecclesiastes

People didn't think it makes sense when they read it in their twenties. 
Context:
   This is written by King Solomon. He looks into comparision, "Ecclesiates 4"
 
What drives people are comparisions. All because of one person's envy to another. It is still relevant
as to today. People uses where they were by looking at where everyone is. Solomon talks about chasing
after the wind has no finish line. This is the same exact parallel as to comparing to other people. There is
no peace from comparision.

King Solomon then states that people who don't do anything ruin themselves. He is saying if you compare to others,
you would self destruct. **Better one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind**.
God can give, and God can take away in anytime. It's better life to give one hand open, instead of two hands clenching for
everything. If you clench everything up, it's like chasing after the wind.

If we allow ourselves to asks: is it possible to to have one hand full of tranquility -- how not to compare to ourselves
to others. When we tend to grab more, people start to ask God for an *extra hand*. This will *never end*.

Solomon sees meaningless under the sun. The story for the men who had no inheritance to leave it to. Finally the men asked:
why is he depriving himself for enjoyment. There is no way in comparision. You will never ever had tranquility by clenching you
hands together -- never get the satisfaction of what you *truly wants.* It's about you wanting more and more.

There is no win in comparision, however How do we choose to live differently? We could *choose* ourselves to hold with one hand
open. The life has always been Jesus's life. There are days that the Pastor is content is happy where he is at, there are 
other days he is more frustrated with his own "not enough". Pastor wants to stir us up, so he is offering a question for to ponder.
