Hebrews 11:6

With out faith it is impossible to please God.
Christian prays in faith and in the spirit.

Religion 101:

All Religion in Christianity believes in 4 things in approach to God.

1. How Many Prayers.
    - They believed that amount of prayers that are prayed gives favor to God.
1. How long you pray:
    - The longer you pray, the more happy God is with you.
    - THey like poeple who pray for hour > less than 1 hour. It's not true.
    - Subconscious level of belief.
    - God didn't love you any less when you prayed.
1. Intensity in Prayer.
    - Old testament, Elijah was on Mount Karmal. Lots of examples in religion that shows the intensity would pleases God.
1. Sacrific a prayer.
    - people believe it's what gives them merit. 

Religion in history is basically how people prayed. A hour a prayer please god: False. God is not pleased unless a hour of prayer comes with *faith*
With out faith, it's impossible to please.

Mathews 6.

Don't be like them -- people who prayed with many words.

"when i prayed, i will not be like heathen -- people who have no relationship with god. I will not think I will be heard for how long i prayed, how many prayers i prayed, how intense they are, or how i sacrifice."

Length of time does not like the merit. With out faith, it's impossible to please God.

"I will not pray ever again, with out faith."

We need God to do stuff -- that's why we prayed.

We go to prayer meeting, it's because we want God to reveal salvation to people, so that they can be saved.

Always do them in faith. Don't think you're going to be heard with out faith. Faith is what *pleases* the God.

Everyone who comes to God, and approach to God. We should never do it, just because it's what christians do. We should never just **go to church**. It should be in an expectation. Don't be in a religious habit.

The point is when you go to the church with you preference, do it in faith. It's because everyone who approach God, they **must** believe.

It's the activity of Heart to trust in God. With out faith it's impossible to please God. Everyone who approach to God must believe in two things:

1. WHO HE IS IS WHO HE IS.
    - Moses with the Burning Bush. God spoke with Moses in the burning bush.
    - "I AM " - God's declaration for who he is.
    - everyone must believe that God is who he is.
    - exists in a life, and does not change. God does not have bad days.
    - God doesn't give out some days irritated. God is consistent. He is always just, and tender, and GOOD.
        - When we worship, we affirm who he is.
        - He has an unchangable character. God can not lie/fail.
        - We must approach God to say that We are coming to him.
        - Everyone who comes to GOd must believe that he is.
"God, you are who you are. You always were. YOu still are, and you will always be. You're unchanging."

God is immutable

Job knew who GOd is in character, and knew that he would never changed. He knew that God is a redeemer.

1. God in nature is a rewarder.
    - He has heard many people prayed like this: "God, we don't want anything from you, because you get sick and tired of us asking all the time. So we just want to be with you."
    - rebellious time is the time people said they don't want anything. That would hurt the parent more than anything.
    - Listen to what God really prefers. Anyone who comes to God must believe he exists in the form that he exists and he is a rewarder.
    - "I WILL ALWAYS PRAY WITH EXPECTATION."
    - Quit thinking that God prefers you to not ask for anything. God will never be sick and tired of asking.
    - We had generations of christians that believed God didn't want anything, however he wants us to ask. He wants to offer that solution.
    - "Ask and keep on asking. Seek and keep on seeking. Knock and keep on knocking."
        - Jesus said that. He wants to teach us in how to approach the father. 

Hewbews 4:16
- Come boldly to the throne of GRACE.
- "THE THRONE OF JUDGEMENT HAS NOT KICKED IN YET."
- Everytime we appraoch GOd, we approach in the God of GRACE.
- We appraoch because A) we expect to receive.

## Three Stories.

- Some guy who want to get healed by Jesus that can't get in.
    - tells the guy to walk, and his sins were forgiven. IT was done w/o a prayer.. Nobody said "please heal this guy."
    - THeir faith had made this man whole.
    
## Story 2

- Crowded people story. And the lady that touched him.
    - the lady admitted it herself.
    - this is called the day of the woman that was healed and not in the will of GOd.
        - who deteremined the parameter of faith that day? the WOMAN. IT was her expectation that had leads her to be made whole.
        - It was "her faith" has made her whole.

Welcome to the faith of christians.

What gives you mert is faith.
