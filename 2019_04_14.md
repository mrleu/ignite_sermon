ZPJ is going to be on a mission trip.

Two weeks ago ZPJ talked about submitting to authority.
More elaboration on **submitting authority**

It also relates to what Pastor David talked about *God's Will and his timing*
- how do you know God's timing in your life.

Recap from two weeks ago.

Submitting authority - more types of examples.

Matthew 8:5-13 - Centurion story.

Historical Context
- Centurion is a roman officer in the roman empire
- in charge of 100 men.
- not Israelite
- probably enforce Roman rule.

Most of hte interaction Jesus had were all with Jewish People. Usually going to the gentiles happened in Acts and later on.

Astounding that there is a roman office that is going to a person that is imposing rule on, and asking for something.

IT's not mainly Jesus' ministry. It's really out of the ordinary
    - even the jewish people did not believe in Jesus
    - yet still believes in Jesus.

### What can we get from this passage?

1. Someone who submit athority knows how to follow orders.

If you don't know what they're doing with their life, you do what they do.

1. Follow Orders.
- hard to grap on the concept, but you know how someone reacts to authority is by seeing how they submit the authority. The person who has the most authority is the one who submits them.

The more that you submit to the authrity, the more it gets to you.

How much do we submit to the authority ourselves.

Delayed obedience is still disobedience.

ZPJ's model always does it a week after his mom told him about it.
- pretty common child problem.
- some people also carried it over the work.

When you submit authority, it actually requires faith.

1. requires faith.

why submitting authority requires faith because you are trusitng God, because God is the one that give authority into your life.

You don't have faith in God when you don't submit to authority.

People want to have control in authority. You felt like you're losign control when you were to submit to the authority.

5 year plans. ZPJ isn't a fan, cuz he's not thinking of working there. ZPJ never stayed at a place longer than 5 years. Maybe that's why adroll goes into the 1 1 2 plan.

ZPJ shares more about principles than actual plan. He placed his plan in God.

Submitting authority only works when you have faith in God - or else it's really realy hard.

*Fake it til you make it* - ZPJ think of it as faith it til you make it.

Going to work is not faking it, but it's faithing it.

1. when you submit God's authority, you are submitting to God's timing.

God's timing is longer than we think. IT's hard for us to wait for things in our generation.

We are by-product of our technology. We are used to having things to be instant.

It's hard for us to submit God's timing, because it takes longer.

### Example of King David.

1. Saul is king of Israel but rejected by God.
1. Prophet Samuel anoints David as king @ ~15YO
1. David then kills Goliath and becomes a hero.
1. Saul then tries to kill David cuz Saul is Jeaous.

Examples and stories continues......

The focus is on David sparing Saul's life twice.

David let God do in his timing.

A lot of us are like David. We know God has placed a great destiny in our lives, however, we are in a rush to get there. We trust ourselves than tursting out God that we are going to get there.

We glorify instant success, however there are very few instant success. God will continue to reveal more destiny in his purpose.

ZPJ will rationalize that 20s is the physical prime of your life -- you'd think if age is physical prime, there are other things that you would want to be prime as well.

ZPJ used to believe that people that are younger and more successfull -- it'd feel weird to be happy for them. it makes him feel like they are doing better than him.

He had problem seeing other people to be successful.
