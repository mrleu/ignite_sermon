Ignite Ministry
=======================

Loneliness when you're serving.

"
Numbers 11:10-25.
"

Moses was very sad about why he was tortured as he brought people to leave the Egypt to the Promise Land.
- consecrate yourself for tomorrow.

ZPJ's visualization:

- he thinks he would want to eat the meat as well.
- Moses sounds like a drama king.
  - he writes and shows people his loss.
- he complains why does he needs to be responsible for these people.
- why does he need to feel like he needs to treat them like that.
  - he even went out being dramatic about being killed.
    - it was so strong that he could not take it anymore.

There were skepticism that they could eat meat for the whole month.
He does not think God can provide the meat for the whole month.
Weight on the shoulder must have felt very real.

However, ZPJ thinks it's kinda understandable.
He needs to provide meat for 600k men -- probably 2.4 million people in the middle of the dessert.

For any type of leadership, when there's one person that complains it would have bothered you.

- ZPJ can not imagine how much weight is on his shoulder.

> - Moses is just following the _lord's will_.

The reason why we feel a sense of burden as we carry more responsibility is because our _actions starts to have consequences_

__It starts to impact people.__

Example:

1. The moment there is a consequences of how the game gets played, suddenly the game gets a more different.
1. When you play poker, people put all in when they are playing, but then they stop playing as aggressively when there's real money.

_What you do will impact all the people._

Decisions won't make _everyone_ happy.

There is a part of us that want to make everyone happy. It's impossible to make everyone happy, and it weights on you.

You then feel even more later.

If you don't do it well, you start have a hunch.

Moses delegates. "HE" shares the power of the spirit.

> The weight that hold you down, you need to be able to share that with others to cut that weight down.

If they are managers, and not managers well -- you call them the _bottle necks_

> If you feel more overwhelm, learn to delegate.

ZPJ tries to do stuff himself.
- sometimes he knows when he feels overwhelm, trust others and delegate -- regardless it was physical or emotional.
- We need to learn to delegate to trust onto other people.

Last you need to __trust Jesus__

Come to Jesus, take the yolk among him, as we find gentle in his heart.

> Matthew 11:28-30

Jesus refers it to another yolk. He gives another standards.
Greater empowerment through the holy spirit.
Previous yolk did not give that empowerment, but Jesus does.

At first the passages start off with Jesus praying over the garden.
- Luke mentions that Angel answered his prayer and strengthens him.
- When you give power to God, God will recover you.

ZPJ felt a bit of overwhelmed.

- felt overwhelmed because he felt like a chill dude.
- God has been giving him talent, but with low ambitions.

God told Jason that it's okay that he doesn't feel okay.

KLove - ZPJ then hears stuff on KLove that feels as if God is speaking to him.

Jesus is the one that helps us get through our burdens.

There are two situations when ZPJ looked back and have no idea how he worked through it.

Before when ZPJ was a zone pastor, he was the chairman of Ignite.
Senior title that was given to ZPJ. He was a chairman and working in finance for full time.

Every week we had rotating speaker. He was surprised how they were able to pull it off.
Surprised how people still stay and believed in what they believe. It must be done by the grace of the Lord.
There is no way ZPJ can do it again, but somehow someway God is able to provide.

It made people grew a lot stronger from then.

I will continue to provide -- somehow somewhere. Trust in Lord, and he will provide.
