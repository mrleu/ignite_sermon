Loneliness when you're serving.

"
Numbers 11:10-25.
"

Moses was very sad about why he was tortured as he brought people to leave the Egypt to the Promise Land.
- consecrate yourself for tomorrow.

ZPJ's visualization:

- he thinks he would want to eat the meat as well.
- Moses sounds like a drama king.
  - he writes and shows people his loss.
- he complains why does he needs to be responsible for these people.
- why does he need to feel like he needs to treat them like that.
  - he even went out being dramatic about being killed.
    - it was so strong that he could not take it anymore.

There were skepticism that they could eat meat for the whole month.
He does not think God can provide the meat for the whole month.
Weight on the shoulder must have felt very real.

However, ZPJ thinks it's kinda understandable.
He needs to provide meat for 600k men -- probably 2.4 million people in the middle of the dessert.

For any type of leadership, when there's one person that complains it would have bothered you.

- ZPJ can not imagine how much weight is on his shoulder.

> - Moses is just following the _lord's will_.

The reason why we feel a sense of burden as we carry more responsibility is because our _actions starts to have consequences_

__It starts to impact people.__

Example:

1. The moment there is a consequences of how the game gets played, suddenly the game gets a more different.
1. When you play poker, people put all in when they are playing, but then they stop playing as aggressively when there's real money.

_What you do will impact all the people._

Decisions won't make _everyone_ happy.

There is a part of us that want to make everyone happy. It's impossible to make everyone happy, and it weights on you.

You then feel even more later.

If you don't do it well, you start have a hunch.

Moses delegates. "HE" shares the power of the spirit.

> The weight that hold you down, you need to be able to share that with others to cut that weight down.

If they are managers, and not managers well -- you call them the _bottle necks_

> If you feel more overwhelm, learn to delegate.

ZPJ tries to do stuff himself.
- sometimes he knows when he feels overwhelm, trust others and delegate -- regardless it was physical or emotional.
- We need to learn to delegate to trust onto other people.
