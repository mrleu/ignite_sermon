# Mark 14:43:72

43: this is where the betrayal of Judas happens. This is why no one names their kid Judas.
  - funny the pastor also mentions no one named their kid Benedict due to the betrayal nature of benedict arnold

One of the twelve - addition knife sharpens into the heart that Judas is 1 of the 12.

45: kisses is the way to show affection, yet in this scenario is was the deadliest blow.

47: who cut off his ear? peter did. in luke 22:49-51.

Jesus is now calling up the scribes and priest and the elders. they could have arrested him at early day, but chooses to do it at night. very cowardly of a choice.

50: they all left him and ran off
- prophecy

this is where the lion becomes the lamb. Jesus was proclaiming his identity, and now he is going to take the atonement of all of our sins.

Mark wants us to center the stage at Jesus alone. IT's all focused about Jesus.

When people fled, it's also prophetic too:

Zacchariah 13:7
The Shepherd Struck, the Sheep Scattered
7 “Awake, sword, against my shepherd,
    against the man who is close to me!”
    declares the Lord Almighty.
“Strike the shepherd,
    and the sheep will be scattered,
    and I will turn my hand against the little ones.

Young man - people scholar thinks its mark. people say it doesn't matter who it was the key is to emphasize that everyone fled away from Jesus.

## Jesus before the counsel
Isaiah 53
He was oppressed and afflicted,
    yet he did not open his mouth;
he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,
    and as a sheep before its shearers is silent,
    so he did not open his mouth.

Peter is following the distance. He is at disillusionment, yet he wants to maintain his promise that he wants to be by Jesus's side. Martk 14:29

No witness agre the same thing.
1. false accusation
1. lies
1. silence
1. carrying our sin.
1. jesus not at fault
1. high priest


Peter
1. true accursation
1. truth
1. rebuke
1. guilty of sin
1. peter at fault
1. woman

Peter is really boasting his failure. plunging the failure leads to the grace that comes within. that's how you lead.
Peter's physical distance also shows his emotional distance from God

fatal blow of jesus was to speak the truth.

great high preist, respectful people spitting at him

Hour has come to fill gods righteous and wrath against our sins. lamb

## Peter denies Jesus

parallel to Jesus
