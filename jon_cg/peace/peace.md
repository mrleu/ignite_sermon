# Peace
Peace has many different uses today. Peace can mean absence of war or an inner state of
mind. It has been used as a greeting or a description of a quiet place. In the Old
Testament, peace (shalom) meant completeness. It was an all-encompassing word that
covered mental, physical, and emotional well-being as well as harmony between people
and a blessing for the good of others.

one, peace, quietness, rest, + set at one again
