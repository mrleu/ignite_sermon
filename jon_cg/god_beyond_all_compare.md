# God Beyond all compare

If they didn't sing so will I, play so will I.

Isaiah 40:12-31
- written by prophet Isaiah
- one of the greatest prophet in old testament
- divide into two parts, one is for the doom of all Israelites, and the other one is to console israelite on future trials

read 12-28 quietly to ourselves

12: lots of metaphors. How does God know all these things. It feels like an amazement rhetorical question. How does God know all these things.

Span- end of thumb to little fingers

Amazement of how god understands.

God understands the ocean, the mountain.
How does God understands us?
Nation is small compare to the knowledge that he knows.

v16:
As the mountains of Lebanon were extensive forests, they would abound with wild animals. The idea is, that all those animals, if offered in sacrifice, would not be an appropriate expression of what was due to God.

Reminds me so will I.
nations feel big to israel, but tiny to God.

no one is close to God. irony in 18-20

20 is spicy. i watched flat earther quote this on jubilee.

21: God has overall controls.

24: things come to god, it then gets blown away.

26: god has knowledge, power, immensity, soverighty, and authority
- God calls all the stars by name, even thought there are billions

God stays the whole time. He doesn't leave, he is always here.


18: beyond comparison.

21-22- god is like the king of all kings.

- so we can see he is much bigger than them.

did you ever feel like vers 27?

29-31 
encoureaging.
he gives us life, energy.

reminds me of matthew 11:
"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
29
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
30
For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
