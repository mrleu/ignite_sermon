    - 2 And they said, “That is not true; tell us now.” And he said, “Thus and so he spoke to me, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord, I anoint you king over Israel.’” 13 Then in haste every man of them took his garment and put it under him on the bare[a] steps, and they blew the trumpet and proclaimed, “Jehu is king.”

so they took branches from the Palm and Olive Trees that lined the road. 

JOHN 3:16
At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him.

# Jesus Curses the Fig Tree - Monday
- Living parable.
Bethany
  - house of figs

Bethphage
  - house of unripe figs.

Irony that the fig tree has no fruit.

Parallel towards what is to come.

Few of the destructive prayer.

Not season for fruit, but should have fruit already.

It wasn't season for fig, yet he was unhappy with fig. Why
  Fig bares fruit before the season for figs.
Fig trees usually have pre fruit before the leaves 

Hypocrisy of those appearing they are bearing fruit, but in fact are not.
  - curse is the judgetment.


# Jesus cleanse the temple.

Comes to purity it.

House designed for house of prayer origin
  - place people buy pigeion, lambs, oil, salt
  - church needs to be a place for prayers, not for robber, theft
  - people in church convert the foreign currency to church currency to buy stuff
  - additionally, they also have badly non-passable offering.
  Nations, not just for the Jews 

Parallel to the fig tree.

Chief priest and scribes want to destroy the purifier
  - motivated by the fear of jesus

# Lesson from the withered fig tree Tuesday

Withered fig tree - judgetment from God

Have faith in God, that anything can happen. Remove all things that hinder from bearing fruit.

24:25
Only given when it's Godly motives. James 4:3
and according to God's will: 1 John 5:14

Careful - some people misuse it.

Prayer is a two fold, ask and forgive 

Mark 11:26 disappeared 
  - why? inconsistent to the old scripture.
  - some has it, some does not.
  - argue it was added by later scribes.


What/why are the people in Bethany do all these work to welcome Jesus
  - coronation of the king.
  - reveal his kingship

# Hermeneutics
1. Why is it important to pray with the attitude that Jesus had described.
  - do we do this prayer? What does it mean to forgive?

1. tell me a time when you had a righteous anger. What happened, and what did you do?

1. Jesus calls the hyporcrisy of the church, what is the best way to call that out in real life.
