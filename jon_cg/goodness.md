Open question:

```
A 10 For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.story is told in the book of Mark where a man comes to Jesus and says, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus responds, saying, “No one is good except God alone.” (Mark 10) Do you agree? What makes someone good?
```

What makes someone good?

1. genesis had a lot of things that God thought was good.
- light

- plants
- darkness

 used to describe his nature.


## PAssage to go through
## Read 2 Peter 1:5-7
```
5 For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; 6 and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; 7 and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love.`
```

why do we not excited to be good?
1. growing up our parents tell us to be good.

lots of steps from faith -> love.
why does goodness needs to be first?

how do you add goodness to your own personality?

When we act out of true goodness of the heart, we are obedient to God’s commandments and seek the benefit of others. Our actions come from a place of selflessness, and we place the needs of others before our own
    - seek to beneift others.
    - life of jesus christ
        - good shepherd
        - good samaritan

no one is good, but god, but now you should good.
    - new creature in christ
    - expected for us to be good.

What Peter wrote.

1. it's for those who had been saved in their salvation, not the ones that need saving.
    1. strife diligently because they are saved.
2. peter calls for diligent, disciplined partener of Christ.
3. everything listed here is the qualities that God has made provision for everyone to strife
4. these qualities are also the trait of God.

THe reason why Peter listed these qualties is to counter what False TEachers are doing.

Faith
- it's a gift from good
- somethign we've received.

Goodness
- moral excellence in NASB
- also, why is goodness before knoweldge?
- all goodness/ virtue

3 Seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence (2 Peter 1:3, emphasis mine).

KJV says virtue: charactoer of GOd

Embracing and pursuing the excellencies of God means having the spirit of mind which exalts the Word of God and explores the Word for the knowledge of Him who saved us. Thus we see how “virtue” or “excellence” precedes “knowledge.”
- we want to desired to be like God for us to want to explore the word of God.

It is Jesus’ glory and virtue that motivated Him to call us, and it is His glory and virtue that draw us to Him.

Mkae every effort
- need to be constatly dilligence.

God wants us to be a whole rounded christian.


Goodness is deplayed in:
```
active benevolence,
a disposition to do all the good we can, and
selflessly acting on behalf of others.*
```

Jesus collected and helped the sick for the good of others.

information alone is not for spiritual growth.

make jesus christ your god, you'd be more  connected with god.

Applicational:
Who has God used to show goodness to you in your life? 

Of the three characteristics of the Good Samaritan–compassion, extravagant giving, and generous investment of time–which is most difficult for you to show? 

How can we do good? how well do i trust in God when life does not go well.
