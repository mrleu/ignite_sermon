lots of questions.

Potentially issues between Jews and Gentile Christians.

Assurance of Hope

God's Everlasting Love

If God is for us, who can stand against us
- empowerment by the holy spirit.
- confirmation that God is with us. nothing to be afraid of.
- jesus is at the right hand of god - confirmation fo what jesus said before. 
- does it mean no one can hurt us
- who can one up god?

God is for all those who has Jesus in them.

nothing can separate us from the Lord's love for us.


32.
rhetorical question that challenges the authority of God can't be overcome.
the fact that God gave us Jesus Christ for our sins to be saved, imagine what other more gifts God has for us.

however this only limits to things that bring Good to the world.

33.
Those found in God will neer be gulitly - God find them to be right before all the world with divine tribunal

34.
Those in God will never be condemned: 1. christ already paid all the penalty, 2. his death is effective because he was risen, 3) he is now seated at hte right hand of God, and 4_ he interceded for his ipeople based on his blood. 
- the power of communoin to be reminded.
  - intercedes meaning to talk to God at hte right throne of God.

If God is your savior, he willl not judge you. Jesus has already been condemned in our place.

36:
Psalmes(44:22)
35 hinted that chrisians in romans are suffering.


37. God turns everything from bad to Good.
- more than conquerers.

38.=-39
- sure nothing else out there can separeed God's people from God's love.

Paul is showing punniness of other in comparison to God.

Paul expectes us to say something.

1. have you ever doubted God love is for you? What made you doubt?

1. in verse 32, does it mean we can take ALL THIGNS? God will give us all things?
1. how was the easter for you? the remembrance of God's risen from the grave signifies all things Jesus said was true, that our sins are truly saved by his death. does that shakes you?
  - i think i was re-minded that God is for us. it's really beautiful that we can recreate our commitement with Jesus with the communion. it's crazy that if jesus did not raise, from the deaht, none of these would every apply.
