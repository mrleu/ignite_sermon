# Mark 4:35- Mark 6:6

## Mark 4

35 - they left the people at the shoreline. 
Jesus calms the storm.
It reminds me of the service that pastor hoa shared with us on how likely we are to choose to go on the shore with him.
Are we going to wait like everyone else? or go into the shore.
It's a miracle that shows in teh natural world.
Galilean boats looke like:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Galilee_Boat#/media/File:JesusBoat.jpg
    - the sea is 696 feet below sea level, which is why it has a violent downdraft and sudden storm.

38: Jesus sleeps
- he has a lack of fear of the nature
- it also shows his fatique, that he needs to sleep. 
- disciples, fear of perishing is stronger than confidence in jesus.
39: Jesus gives dvine power and command to the nature. God has done it in the past too! Job 12:15.

40: seems like the disiciples are unsure who jesus is is at this point too. they ask who is this.

## Mark 5
2. it said Jesus had stepped out. what do the other people do? Did they step out? don't think so. (quote richard rohr)
5. cutting himself - God makes use image out of him, by cutting himself, there's the demonization of hurting the image of God.
Jewish people don't like to go to uncleaned place. they probably didn't go out too. 
6.7 - thi s seems invonlunatirly. the demon takes over the man's voice. 
7. even demon recongizes who God is. 
9 - legion just means there are grat many
11- unclean pigs are common in gentile region
13. many pigs reflect many demons were on teh man. they still want to destory God's creation
16 - superstitious fear
18- jesus denied him to be with the disciples(inner circle)
21. he went back to the other sdie. 
- also reminds me of pastors talking about it few weeks ago. how the women must have read the OT to know that the wings are like the clothes you pull
    Faith causes by healing in the God. Malachi 4
- jeuss also asks us to particpate. 
25-27 - ceremonial uncleaned to be touched by teh woman, but jesus is above all of the purity laws. 
29 - woman fear might come from her touching many people while trying to get to Jesus. 
34: daughter - physical and spiritual healing.
35: contrast with the fact that the Jairus's daughter is dead. 
37: inner circle of disciples. 
39:40 - thoese are paid people that cried for funerals. math 9:23 -- even flute players
41: touchign dead person is unclean in OT.

## Mark 6
Jesus is not accepted in his home ton :( 
- tension with his last family, remmber mark 3:21 with the "WHO IS MY MOTHER AND BROTHER"
3 - his son of god identity was hidden before he turend 33. 
6: jesus does not force his miracle in a hostile environmetn.the fundamental unbelief rejfects him to prevent him from healing. however he continues to teach desised he was not popular.
