## Daneil 10
### THEME: These earthly events are mirros of a great cosmic, conflicts in the heavenly realsm between angelic forces of good and evil. prayer is powerful.
1. Third year -- feels like a shoutout to daniel 1 when it started off as the third year
of Jehoiakim king of Judah.
    -  It is also said that Daniel was there serving until the first year of king cyrus. so this is after he had finished serving.
1. Another context is that in this time, two years before, the first party of jewish exiles had returned to Jerusalem due to the King Cyrus decree, but they still face severe opposition. At this time they had also stopped the rebuilding work. 
1. The fact that it quoted Daniel's name from the Babylonian times shows that it's a formal statement.
1. He also finally understood the vision! Unlike in Daniel 9 that he did not understand it, and just does his own business.

2. When he did not know it, he just goes and does his own business. Now that he knows it, he started mourning.
2. It is also said that he is a very old men. He had did his best to anoint himself for the 3 weeks.
2. he was mourning for the brohters and sisters in Judah. He didn't eat meat or wine, abstrain lotions to in a dry weather.

5. There are two speculation where it oculd come from --
    1. since it needs the help of Michael, he might be an angelic attendatns of God(Ezekiel 1:10)
    1. Others had speculate it to be Jesus -- the pre-incarnated appearence -- given the fact it's similar to the description in Revelation 1:13b-15. 

```
13 and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man,[a] dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. 14 The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. 15 His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.
```
 - however the differences, does not undermine the integrity of the scripture.

12. reassurance from the messenger that Daniel was "greatly loved" by God.

13. Angel had been rushing since Daniel's prayer. His prayer has been heard.
13. This one is powerful. It said it was delayed due to the prince of the kindom Persia.
    - There is a spiritual warfare where an evil angel that resisted God's purpose. 
    - It also said it has delaeyd for 21 days. So as Daniel prays over the oppression of the Jewish people in Judah, there's is also spirtual oppresion.
    - Although it was powerful, it only delayed to 21 days. It could only delay the messenger.
    - When *Michael* finally came, he was able to bring the encouragement to Daniel

20. Battle stills continue, he will go back to fight.
21. book of truth is the plan that God has for Isaraelites.

### Heterenuetics

1. how does daniel's experience encourage you to be persistent in prayer.
1. the prince of persian kingdom who resisted God's messenger probably refers to a powerful evil spirit who influenced the affair of the Persian government. What does this "unveiling" of demonic activity in political affair teach you about our world.

## Daniel 11

It's a history from Daniel time(late sixth century BC until the end of the world)
- it shows God's assurance of control of HIstory. It goes from Persians, to Alexander's Greeks, then it gets hit with Selucids and Ptolemies.
- the vision reassurance that God's concern for his people, and how he uses his people to bless the world.

135 prophecy was revealed!


1. first year of Darius the Mede - year when the decree that allows the Jews to return
  - Stood up to confirm and stregthen -- it means the messengere had taken in parts of the event to allow Jews to return.
2. Three king rices up after cyrus. Fourth king was Xerxes, who invaded Greece, but defeated at the battle of Salamis.
3. Talks about the downfall of Persian empire by Alexander the Great. He is the mighty king.
4. After Alexander had died, it has been separated to 4 generals -- which none were his kids.
Alexander died from party, drunk, wet, caught malaria. 

**These stuff are about Egypt and Syria now**
The Ptolemies(puh-TOLEMEES) in Egypt -- SOUTH
Seleucus(SEH-LEU-CUHZ) in Syria, Babylon, and Media -- NORTH

They were the most influential to Israel.

5. Ptolemy 1 was a general under Alexander who became the ruler of Egypt.
- Seleucus was one of the prince of Ptolemy when he fleed from Babylon when Antgonus took over.
- Seleucus returned after Antigonus was defeated. Seleucus returned and increased power to be stronger than Ptolemy.

6. Conflicts between Ptolematic and Selucid kingtom. Ptolemy II wanted to make peace with Antochus II by sending his daughter Berenice to marry him. **Exactly as predicted**
    - Antochus II wanted to disinheirt his wife Laodice and her sons to marry Berenice. But Laodice had the king and Berenice Poisoned. **fulfilling the words that she shall not retain stregnth of her arm and he and his arm shall not endure** Same year the king died in Egypt.

### Geeking out in history
4 divisions post Alexander is 1. Antigonid dynasty in Macedonia, 2) Ptolemic dynaasty in Egypt, 3) Seleucid dynaasty in Syria
Other 2 were: Lysimachus,  Cassander

Judea was between egypotian and seleucid. 

There was a Maccabean Revolt, and establishment of Hsmonean Dynasty -- Mattathias. It rules over a century until Judea was conquered by Roman General Pompey.

7. Ptolemy III was suceeded from Berenice's brother **branch from her roots** in retalization, invaided selucid kingdom and conquered its capital Antioch**rise an army to enter the fotress of the king of the north**
- he took the Gods of Syrian and other precious veseels and gold and returned to Egypt. He did refrain on tackling so he could work on expanding his kingdom. Seleucus II must have later made a swift retreat back to his own home. 

10. Ptolemy III and Seleucus III continues to fight. Seleucus III was murdered with a short reign. Antiocus III campaigned in Plestine so that he made it as far as his fortress.o

11. Ptolemy IV defeated Raphis in Palestine. Ptolemy IV cast down tens of thousant, yet short lived. he shall not prevail. He gets weaked as Seleucid gets stronger.

13. invasion of area with great army by Anticous III.

14. there as lots of rise against Ptolemy V, even large numbers of jews who were tired of taxation. zbelieved seleucid are preferable. 

15-16. egyptians were defaeted. it is under Syrian control.

17. after scopas defeat, egypt forced into alliance with syirans. Antiochus III gave his daughter Celopetra to Ptolemy V in marriage. Antichus hoped offspring can rule over Egypt. but Cleopetra supported Ptolemy instead of father. When Antichus III was defeated by Roman and Greek, treaty is forced to signed, and forced to pay laruge tribute, and he was killed by angry momb. Coastland is asia minor.

20. son was poisoned by the tax collector Heliodorus

24. antichus IV retailiated and pluntered, but only for a short time.

antiocus deceivt to be where he is at. he also wages war with people. he then lost to the coast, because the ship was supported by greece. in frustration, he takes it out on jewish people. he puts zeus statue up there, slaughter the pig in the temple, force feed pig's blood to the great high priest, replaced with another great high hpriest. people who knew god still stays firm.

32 is a good one. 
34 as well, the stumble would still receive a little bit of help!

Mccabean revolt!

### Heterenuetics

1. Antiochus invaded egypt the first time with relative success. the second time he had some opposition and in his frustration vented on the "holy covenant" why do you think God lets genuine believer to suffer under the hand of the godless system.
1. all of 1-35 are future to daniel, but past to us. looking back, we can see precisely God's plan came true. God really is in control! How can God's absolute authority and rule over history help you to stand firm whem evil seems to triumph.
