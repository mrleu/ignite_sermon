Lord put in Pastor's heart for the fire of God that's in their hearts.
- God is a consuming fire.
- Fire of God -- passion to love for the Lord. Able to do his will.

  - gotta do that _body check_ - heat check

- don't want no normal christianity

- Reading the bible, it sees people that want to turn the world __upside down__

We are on fire for the Lord, and God wants the fire to __increase__.

- be contagious, and fire for the lord for others.
- prayer time for fresh fire. 

We don't know pastor marcus' story. We just think he's a random guy. 
He wants to talk about his story, so it could reignite hte fire in our heart

Sometimes he feels like there are seasons that are _dry_.

- he's doing the work of the lord, but he doesn't feel that fire that he once felt. 
- he sometimes need to go backwards to be reminded of his freshest fire.
- freshest fire is when he _first got saved_

#### Context
- got saved in 22.
- kaballah church
- christmas to easter only church goer
- then he stops going. 
- thank God that Catholic told him that Jesus Christ is God.
  - Heaven made him the lord of the heart. 
  
  
he didn't know he was suppose to read the bible

- his parents, faithful catholic, didn't know the bible.
- who taught him? the world, culture, friends. 
- starts to go into the world of promiscuious(?) life
- didn't know sex is a sacred thing. had been sleeping around. 
- didn't know there's a soul ties. 

## "there is no condom that could save up your soul"

- he is living crazy, getting drunk. 
- he got drunk, experimenting with different drugs, and have a real chaotic life.
- God still _looks down upon him_ and bring a _shift in his life_

### No one had told him bout jesus

#### Holy spirit of god is moving in him.

- Holy spirit is finishing up the work.
- this crazy life, and one day
  - high on ecetasy 
  - now calls it false joy
  - on oakland, and GOd sees him as a son to rescue.
  - drives down to one street, and sees a cross.
    - that day happen to be the resurrection sunday.
  - he went to the church to say a prayer.
    - turns out it was the _holy spirit_ that gave him a visitation to change his life.
  - went to the church, turns out it was closed.
  - pastor came out. he asked the pastor to pray for him. 
  - now in west oakland. it's a God initiated thing. 
  - pastor prayed from his heart/his soul.
  - he said he wantd to come, but not now because he doesn't want to be diresepectful
  - pastor said __church is like a shower. you don't get in the shower clean. you go to get clean__
  - gave marcus the business card with the pastor's family.
    - the fire of god was there.
  - one day he went to the church.
  - he walked in with some girl. they asked for the alter call. they found it so real.
  - pastor marcus walk up to the alter
  - they have been praying for marcus that they would send him back to church.
  - he ended up coming back to the church, and gave his life to the Lord.
  - no longer sleeping around, and party to find some kind of joy. 
  - he actually got the healing.
  - pastor of the testimony. don't be ashamed of the _testimony_
    - bible is the story when you encounter __God__

Book of Acts is still written in your life.

__This is the fire of God.__

Pastor Macrus always wants to go back to fall in love with Jesus.
- such a blessing for him.
- wants to be a blessing to other people's lives.
- never turned back. God captured his heart. amen!!
- now he is __called__ to be contagious. 

__initial encounter with Jesus__

Being saved is an entrance to Kingdom of God.
- he wants to do so much more by giving you a pass into the Heaven.


Marcus wants to find more about God. 

- Someone else in the bible has the same thing too. it's MOSES WAHHHH.
- _now speaking context of who Moses is.._
- it was God taht sees if Moses is interacting with his invitation as the burning bushe.

He wants right nwo to be the __burning bush moment__

Asks the Lord of GOd to see. 

Moses had been setting people free.
- cloud by day, and led fire by night.


First thing we need to do to keep the fire burning
- daily be hungry for hte fire of God.
- a personoal relationship with God.
- scipture Exodus 20:18-21.
  - cultivate relationship with God. 
- people stood afar, but moses drew near. 
- a lot of us choose: far off, or drew near to where moses is. 

Those people didn't want to go where God is. 
- sometimes it sounds like church to them. 
  - wants to hear what Pastor had studied, and pastor to pray for me.
  - if you want the fire of God, you need to be _committed_ to grow that relationship with God.
- God wont be able to speak to you in big crowd. it's too distracting. 
- if you go to quiet place, it will tell you things that you may be _running away from_

__Daily Encounter with God__
- THe fire of God is meant to purge your way, and burn anything that is not of God, and set everything else that is in God on fire.
- wants to draw you near to him. 
- when you draw near to God


It is important to have the FIRST HAND INTERACTION.

- sometimes we have never encountered God first hand. 
- people that know their God will carry out _great exploit_
- will do great things to impact this world.
- the only way to keep the fire burning is to have a car down fire
  
What does that mean?? ah it goes into the 1st KING. Elijah.

- genuinwine God has always been around you, but you became selective.
- there's a showdown. 
- he called the 850 of hte demonic prophet to meet him @ the top of the mountains. 
  - pray to ansewr by fire.
    - pray to see which one is the real God. 
    
- the reason why there's a lot of people cautting themselves, because they wanted to imitate the blood of jesus.
  - witch craft
  
if you want the fire of God in your life, you need to be like Elijah and be risky.
- something that you could fail unless God step in
- sometimes we worry about getting embarrased. 
- need to take God assignment.
- who likes being saved.
  - Book of Bible is full of supernatural.
  - Jesus is born of a virgin. that is miracle it self. rose of the dead. there goes the natural out the door. 
  
  
### 1 more story!

Always Want to be passionate for God. 

Marcus always ask for assignment. God always put you into situations.

after he got saved, his family got saved.

- a whole bunch of people came to Jeus.
  - he wants _all of you_

one of his uncle had a drug addiction, and asked the family for help.

**Holy spirit is trapped in unbelieving believers.**

it sometimes get trapped, because you don't believe God can do things that are supernatural.

1. keep on _stepping up_ on God's challenge. 
1. step on what God is challenges.
1. go through the fire

God has been speaking into him.

Fire of God to go into something like a miracle, emotional.

Fire of God goes through the form of Trials -- when it does not feel good.

1 Peter 1:6-7

- In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you ahve been grieved by various trials.

- God allows testing for sometimes. 
- the genuwineness of your faith, God wants to _test_ your faith if it is genuineness.
  - thought it is tested by fire to be, praise, honor, and glory to the revelation of Jesus Christ. 
  
Your __TEST BECOMES YOUR TESTIMONY__

- Peter is the best perseon that past and failure of the test. 

  - king of passing and failing the test: simultaneously.
  
Biggest test is when Jesus is about to get crucified. 
- Peter did not open to say he is the follower of Christ. 

John - there is a details that everytime when God gets denied, Peter would warm himself.
- when we _fail our test_  of the spirit, our fire doesn't increase. it gets decreased. 
- Peter starts to get colder as he denied Jesus that he is one of his disciples.

Test is not mean to destroy you.
- we are not tested to fall. we are tested is to show that we can stand. 

He believes people that warm around the fire, everyone was cod. everyone woudl grow cold. We need to _warm up the world_. 

It's family member that is going to see you. You are called to pass the test. 

During the test of purity. 

Marcus went 10 years with out sleeping around.
- didn't have sex until they get married. 
- beginning it was hard for him. 
- he went through the test. 
- Marcus turned made his house most unromantic. 
- he is going to stop playing games, and he doesn't do what others do anymore. 
- he wants to live pure before God.
