## 1. Our God is able

- He is able to do things that are beyond our imagine.
- Isrelites have all experienced the greatness of our god.
- Psalms 72:58
- No other GOd bu thte God of Israle does Marvelous Deeds. 
- Israelites know how much God has blessed them since the Father Abraham.

Question: What would be the greatest event the jewish know God had done to them?

- Exodus! 
- Jewish people had been living for many years. 
- God called moses to set the people free.
- Moses let two millions people hurry quickly exited out of Egypt. 
- In the middle of the escape, Pharoah realizes a lot of slave and people left.
- Then the Egyptians realized they can not let them go.
- Pharoah then sends 600 of the best chariots to chase after the Jewish people.
- God tells Moses to stretch the staff to split the red seas. 
  - jewish people than just walk across the red sea.
  - After the last person crosses the red seas, Moses stretch his staff again, then
    the red seas came back to normal.
- God alone does Marvelous deeds. This is the story that gets passed down.
- Exodus 15:11-12 is the song people do to celebrate the victory.
  - Nobody is like our God.
  - The whole Egyptian armies and chariots were all swallowed by the red sea!
  - Our God is *able*

If you don't know what to do, you should know God is able and do marvelous things. In
this new season, God can do things that are immeasurable to our own understanding. God
can actually choose angels to do things, however God still chooses you and I to do great
work.

## 2. God chooses us!

1. God put his power in us.
  How can Got then choose us? It is because God has put his great power in us.

  When you have declared God to be your lordship, Holy Spirit has then come into your heart. You
  can then call onto Abba father. This great power is in us, and therefore God uses us so HIS power
  can be spread to multiple places through you and I. 
  We all have *treasure*. God has chosen you and I to do HIS work, because HE has put his power in us.
  We need to push the power like the car engine, so we can know that God's power is in us. God has talked 
  about multiple times of how his power is in us in Corithians.

  >We are hard pressed on every side, but no crushed, perplexed, but not in despair...
   - 2 Corithn 4:8-9.

  Jesus says he will never abandon us. Persecution may come, but remember to praise the Lord, because God's treasure is in us. 23-4 years ROLCC has gone through a lot, but God's power is still in us.

1. God Wants to us to do miracle with him.

  God can just say a word, and it would happen. Even though God can do many things, He still wants to partner up with us. This is happening within the 4 Gospel where Jesus uses us to feed the 5000 with the fish and the bread.
  
  > Matthews 14:15
 
  Jesus was talking 3-4 hours until it was dark. People wanted something to eat, but there's nothing that can be offered to the people. 
  > "You give them soemtihng to eat" Mark 6:37
  
  They have only counted the men, imagine if each men has 3-4 kids, there far more than 5000 people.
  
 Luke - about 5000 men were there. The number is real. Luke is know for his skill as doctor -- he is very detailed. In John, it talks about how Jesus did it. In retrospect, Jesus only uses it to test them. Jesus already had in mind to know what he was going to do. As we cry out to God, this may have been only a test as God may know what he wanted to do with us. Jesus already had in mind how to provide the finances. He may already have in mind how to get out of the current situations. Andrew found a boy with 5 small barley loaves and two small fish. For context: Andrew is probably not a men of faith. Fish is probably a small fish. How to feed so many with little food. Jesus did it and blessed it in their own eyes. We don't know how the fish gets multipliedd -- Pastor Hingchai probably going to ask about how he did it on heaven.

  Not only God is able to give into their needs. They even get extra fish for the given loads. Pastor HingChai thinks Jesus might have given the extra basket to the boy. It may have been something that is most unforgettable from the boy. How can someone take from something small to make it into something that is incredible. God wants to let us know that there is *power* in us. The disciples did not believe God's power, even Andrew wanted to challenge it, but Jesus proved them wrong.
  
 When we invite God inour relationship -- God + US == MORE! We can then do immeasurably more not because of us, but because God's great power that is in us. 
 
## God + US == More

1. More is beyond measure.

  God can do beyond immeasurable things. When you go to mission, you experience more -- you multiply. Maybe sometimes you feel limited when you're in ROLCC, but if you go to togo and other places, you realize how there are things that you can do that is beyond your imagination. God plus us == more. Jewish people only asked to escape safely, but God provides more.
  
  > Eph 3:21 to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generaitons, forever and ever! Amen

  The blessing goes more generation to come. This is why God invovles with us, so we can work together with him. We should not despise ourselves. No matter what background we've come from, God has chosen us to do great work.
  
  You can see GOD is doing something great when you see shikinah glory. Whether you like it or not, you're in the river when you go to river of life, and the river is going to flow. God is going to be hungry and thirsty for GOD. We are all waiting to meet our LORD Jesus Christ.
