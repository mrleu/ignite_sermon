      - did not see the God's transformation he had intended.

# Pastor Jules Moore(?)
- Generation Pastor @ shiah church?
- Marcus worked closely with Jules. 
- Jules taught Marcus everything he knows.

- *seed that you sow has huge reminification*
- *God has called **Howard** to work in his working place*

### Context
- 16 years in ministry. 
- 33 this year!
- they let him run youth ministry.
- there are then 65 middle school students.
- has two kids! Wife is leading worship right now.
- Mathew 20

# It's not Fair!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(Jules Moore wanted us to write that down)
- other people's life!! how can they got this, and we got this??
- pastor wants to bring resolution
  - young christian has mentality that God has *cheated him/her on something*
  - God hasn't *blessed this/that person*
    - very destructive.
    - ruining your future in serving jesus christ
- Let's talk about how does politics *play* at Heaven.

### Mathew 20 Jesus has talked about this so clearly!
- At Mathew 19, Jesus confronts the man that has everything.
  - the men was conflicted to sell everything
  - book never concluded what happened. 
  - he was filled with despair, afraid, and walked off.
- pastor believe that's what we *look like* in this generation.
- when we want to pick up the cross, there's a *great conflict*

** am i truly going to serve God because i love him, because i'm the son of god/daughter of God**

- Mathew 20:1-34
- context: dayworker. it's a metaphor in how God works, and how you see how God working in our *earthly realm*
- interesting thing: he goes out at 5 PM.
  - people expect to receive more when they work more.
  - "i am not doing unfair, did you not agree with me for a denarius"
  - "don't i have the right to do what i want with my own money"
  - are you jealous because of what i choose to be honest.
- jesus continues to recruit.
  - he pays the ssame
  - currency of money in heaven is the _grace of God_
  - God could show your heart when he does _grace for somoene_. it may be something that of wicked.
- Jesus says whoever wants to be great, needs to be the __least__
  - never said desires for greatest is a horrible thing.
  - shows the proper process to show that greatness.
  - how to _leverage_ that greatness.
  
** Break the spirit of comparision **

- usually you see it's not fair when somone gets more than you've earned.
  - pastor is a middle child.
  - his bro would get freedom, access
  - his lil bro would get away with anything.
- something happens when you compare your _status_ with everyone else.
- everyone is jummping for all the inequality abuses.
- probably the combination of both.
- something is twisted when people want to exhaust their platform to talka bout their justice when it is simply not true.
- people of the world ** do not know true justice and equality really means!!**
  - what's fair to you may not be fair to other people. 
- in the kingdom of god, there is not _judge_ that is necessary.
  - if god wants to do something for you, he does it.
  - he is a JUST God.
  - dude, this totally reminds me of Job!
    - maybe we just dont know what is Just in God's perspectivce.

### The crazy thing is, you only see something that's unfair when you see in perspective of *God's Grace*

- inequality is based on what grace you're lookin at.
- you've been serving God since you were a kid. 
  - been doing the right thing. then someone else who had done the evil stuff, and gets radically saved.
  - that person gets more opportunity.
  - depending on how you look @ grace, you may not think that is fair as well :( 
  
### You may have a __poor__ definition of what fair is, and what grace is. BOOM.

- we should be celebrating the grace of God of HE is putting it into someone else's life.
- this would flips all the __ACCESS__
  - stop worrying about how you are getting _paid up_
- if you are work and serve to get a pat on the back
  - you might be seving for the wrong kingdom.
  - do you trust in his kingdom, or trust in his validation of the man.
- it's _God's Grace!_
  - God goes __beyond Fair__
  
## **Do you really want God to be fair?**
- misplaced your grace, which is why you are bitter
- when you have a proper understanding of God's grace
  - God sees you as a son
  - you then see other people also as sons and daughter.
- sometimes you get the life of joseph, and gets deported.
  - sometimes God is going beyond fair to show grace to show other people, he is showing *maturity* growth in you.
  
### Story Time.
- pastor and two kids; not having enough sleep.
- his one daughter gets jealous. One daughter gets carried all the time, while the other one is jealous and wanted to be picked up more.
- his daughter didn't realize that there's so much grace that needs to be shown to become 3. 
  - she needs to mature, so pastor can focus on others that they can be matured.
  - time for you to *grow up*
  - get over yourself.

## God's grace is a lot stronger, and has a calling for you to do something. 
- if you are building for your own king, than it's a problem
- no demon in hell, political power can separate from Love of GOd and God's grace.

### This is how God's grace works -- he gives the grace to the last person first.

- hermeneutics
  - at work -- are you focus in building in your own kingdom?
  - hard to define the true kingdom if you look @ your own.

### Another Story Time.
- this girl who's latin american. 
- pastor preaching. she was saying the right word, but the wrong kingdom.
- interpretation is something that is _totally different_
- we'd be in spiritual jam if God's equal has been implemented.
- it is not in the secular kingdom.

### Jesus pays the last one first.
- people would complain.
- the person that didn't deserve it, they appreciate it. 
- the person that awaited, when they get it, how do you think they are going to handle it.
  - had time to think about it. 
    - turning dinaros to falaffel shop(hahah)

### Sometimes the promise and the blessing destroys them when it comes up too quickly. 
  - Question of the day: what are you doing to prepare?
  - 24:28. God seems unfair when you have the wrong _motivation_
    - it may seem like God is being unfair. 

#### People have no idea what preaching is responsbile for.
- people critique pastor sermons
- __everybody wants to be great, and everybody _can_ be great__
- Jesus confronts the _motivation_ for why we want that. 

Pastor now pulls out the cape.
- he is now putting up a pink cape.
- superheroes are awesome.
- talks about how awesome superheroes are.
  - everybody wants this status.
  - it's not wrong that people want that role.
  - the question to ask about it is _why you want that role_?
- Jesus is asking this
  - I dont want you to be wearing cape, I want you wear an apron(cape becomes an apron)
  - there's no capes in the _kingdom_.
  - they must be someone who is willing to serve. 
- Want to run the company in corporation because i belive people in power and what people do is to serve those that is misfortunate
  - leverage the health and economic status
  - __why you are acheiving these things is what matters__
- WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE RECOGNIZED?
  - are you serving somewhere?
  - when did you stack the chair?
  - pastor needs to be reminded that this role is meant to _serve for other people_
- if you come in and say how do i serve for you
  - even if nothing worked well, there's no shame that's attached to it.
- If god is with you, you might get tehre a lot faster.
