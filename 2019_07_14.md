### ZPJ - Faith

Hebrews Ch 11-6

- anyone who comes to him must believe he exists

If no faith, it does not make senes to believe in God.

God wouldn't be God if we could fully understand God.

    - There is something that we might never comprehend.
    - some point in time it may never make sense.

People wanted to come to God to get an explanation.
By definition, we can't really fully get a grasp of fully who God is.

This is where the leap-of-faith coming in. God's reward is contradictory to our definition of rewards.

__Godly wisdom looks on the inside.__

Something new that came to Jason on what level he understood.

Human Nature(ZPJ) had habit to look at the outside. God was showing him that everything he needed is already on the inside.

We often look outside for the need, but we have the needs on the inside.

1.  Faith is needed to please God.

_Matthew 17:20_

- Mustard seed is one of the smallest seed. Jesus meant to move the mountain.

With faith, nothing is *impossible for you*

1. Faith can do the impossible.

James 2:17

Faith by itself is dead if not combined with action.

- Faith needs to be accompanied by some action.
- True genuine faith is combined with some action.
- Doing something can be a quiet prayer by your self.
- Faith accompanies action

1. Faith is needed to produces action

Matthew 13:31-32

What God does is like a mustard seed.
God does to us may start off with something small, but would expand to be big enough to take on broad shoulders.

Christians also had started small too.
    - Martyred of the original disciples.

Now, Christianity is probably the most __significant event that happened in the human history__

Now, people know their stories and named their kids after them.
What started off as a small mustard seed is now something that everyone in the world has heard of.

1. Faith can change teh world

### Relates to Ignite.

2008 was a sunday night

It started back in 2008.

Spritual Growth is painful, but you just gotta kept on going forward.

Hard to do at a congregation here - young adult, charaismatic, ethnic church that is immigrant.
Takes a lot of faith to get to this point.
You all have a part to play to make it happen.
ZPJ wanted to say thank you for making it possible.
Testimony to God's faithfullness.
We get to see faith through action.
We can continue to use faith to change the part of the world.
It has now slowly grown into a tree, find rest in branches.

Hebrews 11:6

Rewards we think of as materialistic things.
Ultimate reward to have relationshp with God is the relationship with God.
Having share of same experience with Jesus Christ.

 How would you want to have conversation with Jesus when you go to heaven.
    - How do you want to have back to forth conversation to God about your struggle and testimony?

He hopes that *everyone who comes to ignite that you have a closer relationship with God because of Ignite*

Continue to point and funnel people to God.
Hopees everything is a small way that lead people to God.
