# Pastor Marques

Making bad decisions when you go to market when you're hungry. You'll go all over the grocery store with bad rationale.
The hunger can over take our decisions when we are hungry in grocery decision.

Esau and Jacob. They are fighting for birthright. Genesis 25:25-34. Esau is called EDOM.Esau sold his birthright to jacob.

Esau despises his birthright. To some of us, we think it is a dumb decision. What's important about the birth right? it means
this son gets the double portion for the father blessing. Also when the father passed away, son becomes the head of the  house.

Esau did something wrong:
1. He did not see the thing that is valuable to him to be valuable.
  - People also tend to make bad decision when they are tired.

Our emotions would make us irrational, doing things that is not of intended. Do things that are non-lasting birthright.

Pastor believe that each mother have a twin within us. We all have an Esau and Jacob. Esau is the flesh side that wants
flesh desires. Jacob is the spiritual side. It knows what it good. There are two brothers among us, but whoever you feed more, 
that one will grow more. Whoever grow more, it will be won for the battle of your soul.

Food is only symbolic for temporary things. There are the eternal things and the temporary things.

We struggle with pursue of being rich. We want to be secure and rich.
Sometime we don't search for riches, but we just want to spend all of our money to obtain things. These are freshly desires
that are happening in our lives. Jacob entering in Esau's weakness to steal his strength. 

The devil might just be taking away your money. It compromises things that you feel like you valued most. He wants you to
overwork, so your kids will have a father and not a dad(because you're not there for availability.) Esau allows his fresh to
be a door way. 

Another story is Samson. Samson has 7 dreadlocks, and that's where his power comes from. He has problem with temporary things - 
sex and lust of the fresh. We all got these temporary desires that we allow in.  Delilah cuts his dreads and then Samson gets
imprisoned. Samson lost his vision from his lust.

We have libery, as the pastor is talking, the holy spirit is opening some doorway entrances in your life. Let the holy spirit
download these some sort of in our head for reflection.

Esau lost his birth right. Enemy wants to steal your identity, so it can alter your destiny. After Esau ate the red stew, his name has 
changed to Edom. His name has been named after the red stew. Esau beging to carry the identity of his _mistakes_. The birth right was
going to be belong to Esau. If you choose not to commit to the obedience of God, it changes your destiny.

Pastor wants to make sure he closes the door that is not of Holy Spirit. The things that desire for God is called the Spiritual Desire.
The twin brother were struggling, and the God did reveal to Rebecca that younger one is going to lead the older one.

There is the concept of prophetic destiny. There are  things that we are wrestling, and God has asked us to wrestle these spiritual things.

## new testament.

Jesus also has some spiritual appetite.

Here are the top 3 things:

1. Luke 10:38. pastor sees two appetite that we should be hungered for. Mary choice the right part to be hunger for the presence of God.

God want to restore us so that we get to hunger God and restore the relationship. Sometimes the Pastor just goes into enjoying god's presence. 

2. Second. Revelation of God flows downwards. God wants us to hunger for his word. God still gives word to us in our current lives.

There is also the prophecy of Amos, of how there is going to be the day where famine hits. It's going to be a famine of hearing to the word
of God. Amos8:11. It's the hearing of the lord's voice. God only speaks when we silent ourselves.

Pastor just celebrated 7 years of opening up a barbershop. He then decides to close the shop and just goes into the mentality to enjoy God's
presence.

Lou Angle(sp?): "when you dream, you need to go into the dream angle. In dream stream, you'll be connected to dream team." If pastor marques didn't
silence himself, he would have missed the opportunity to hear God and hear his words afresh.

3. Jesus directly even said "My food is to do the will of him who sent Me, and to finish his work."

Harvest is the fruit of they havest(the people) that they bring to for the entire life. When he sees other people getting saved, that's the fruit.

People had come to get saved. Sometimes when you win the one, you win them all. During bapstim, Marques's brothers were saved too.
