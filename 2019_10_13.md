# Ignite MInistry

Acceptance by the Trinity

1. Father is the source of relationship an affection
1. The son is the concrete expression of God's gracious offer of relatiosnhip
1. SPirit is ongoing embodiment of GOd's offer of relationship

We pray to God of Father.
    - we see prayer model, Paul is speaking to God the father.

WHy is it important?

## How to become an adult in the spirit

- important because part of becoming an adult is to come out of the family origin and come into this new family where
God the father is your parent.

- Get new identity

Modern concept - there's lots of psychology is to see what is in the past.

Acknowledge what is real in the psychology, but rooted in the gospel

## Growing up with family

Academic achievement is/was extremely important
    - they just expect the outcome.

When Pastor Mok came home to school, he would look at the report cards.
    - his father would be silent for a couple of days.
    - when he didn't perform academically, he would see it as withdrawn relationship

When people are silence to him, it's the most painful things.
    - outside of silent treatment, he's usually good with showing affection.

Carry forward in relationship with God. Strong sense that if he didn't perform, there is a withdrawn relationship

Did not feel intimacy wiht dad.

1. lack of intimacy.
1. lack of trust.

Still mapped the idea who God is by what he sees when he was little.

__what is like to be an adult__

Most asian culture -- you're never an adult.

Have adult relationship with your parents.

Ephesians

### Being an Heir
    Ephesians 1:13-14.

Somoene who receives an inheritance is called an "heir"
    - heirs were male and adult
    - adult son was the person who is worthy to accept inheritance.
    - prove that you're worthy for an inheritance

Holy Spirit is a type of _seal_/_engagement ring_ that you will receive the salvation
God is so committed to you that he gives part of you as seal.
You get to keep part of God.

When you receive an inheritance, and God is committed to you. There's an assurance for the future.

Especially if you're child of immigratns, we get stability from wealth. It's to have secure economic future.

There's something more important than money -- that is eternal life.

There's something abou tthe security. Give us assurance about the future.

### Before Adoption
    Galatians 3:23-25
Some people want to follow the old covenant.
You have to follow some behaviors before christ.
    Galatians 4:1-3
### Adult son Adoption
    Galatians 4:4-5
Adoption is adoption for an adult son.

You are no longer slave, but son/heir to God.

Summary:
- You used to be kids, than adults in Christ. Now you've come back to being kids.

You need someone to show you what is right or wrong. You need someone to protect/show you what is right or wrong.

before these peopl knew jesus, they were enslaved to the world.
    - enslaved to the jewsih laws.

Status is dependent on how you are behaved. how his family operate before they became christians.

THey added different classes of christians.

Judaism seeing it as second class.

In christ, you are all adults.

Reconcile in humanity to God is the _son_

Jesus the son is going to do everything necessary for you to be an adult(make us to have full participant)

Going to allow it, so we can be fully adopted.

Jesus allows us to be the __full adult.__

destroy the linkage of under the law.

make you the son and daughter by faith.

Spirit of Son speaks to us, speak from our hearts to God.

Holy Spirit speaks to us in emotion.

Spirit is the experience of _God's love_

Most of htem have experience. Joy of the spirit. Spirit is the emotional experience to be an Adult to God's son.

Pastor Mok's dad express affection by cooking. Holy spirit's role is to make you feel loved. Romans 5:5.

God's love is poured out by his spirit.

Emotions validates our understanding of the truth.
You're still responding to God as if you're still a child.
    - 8-9. still feel like you have to earn God's love by behavior

Luke 15 - Prodical Son
Three Titles - Heir, Slave, Son.
Younger son asks for inheritance.
Sonship is not depended on your behavior. Right as an adult son is now how you're performed.


Son: I have been a child to have intimacy and trust from you based on my behavior.
    - he kind of says he wants to be a slave forever
    - that's not how God relates to us.

While the entire time, the father trusts them the same the entire time.

Abba is important because it means dad.

Spirit of God is not silent.
    - he cries out dad.
    - it reensure him that the trust is on the father, but not on the behavior.

Son went to the plane by himself. pastor fred does not trust his kid. he now experiences passing the lack of trust.
    - his son went out mexico trip.
    - 24 hours he got a call that he lost his passport.

How does God treat him?
    1. God the father said "you're my son/daughter, and you're allow to make mistakes"

It's ok to make mistakes. God trusts us enough to make mistakes
    - Father and hte spirit sitll says i still trust you.
    - adults have bandwidth to make mistakes.

empowers us to be trust worthy.

Spirit of God is about being faithful sons/daughthers.

Asking god to help him to feel the trust in his son to put it to his kids. even when the time it felt like he had failed.
    - part of learning is to do dumb things.

Remind ourselves in teh morning, and in particular that the spirit of sonship is in your heart.

- fully competant to make mmistakes.
