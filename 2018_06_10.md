### Justice - breaking of peace, and how do we address to it?
- for us, maybe our idea of justice is _screwed up_
- our value of justice **is mis-calibrated**
- we could understand what justice is really like by studying in the bible.
#### bible is difficult to read
- old testament is weird -- more soap opear, torah is weird
- rules are weird. 
- Pastor Fred always had problem with Leviticus.
 - too much connection with blood?
 - what does it make of it?
#### Exodus 24 3-8
- splashing blood to the peopel as it  is the covenent Lord had made with words that people will follow.
- covenant **God is making with these people**
  this is how you're going to live. 
- we are going to go through some detaisl.
- ** consists of ten commendents**
- *what comes between the commaedent and the radification*
- **expansion of the comendements**
Context: Israel is a buerocracy 
- Religous run state. 
- moses run the government. laws how israels are going to live by.
- current context: separate between church and state.
Second idea: __peace__
- sent young israel men for _peacee offering_
two types of offering
1. burnt offering: completed _consumed_
2. peace offering: shalom(hebrew) internal + external harmony. how we get along with each other.
## You kill the peace offering, and you eat _eat it_

  - why is it no 1:1? why is it 1 to many in return?

#### __what's wrong with it?__

#### Brandon's testimony
- if the people just apologize.
