## Pastor Fred Mok

Ephesians 5.

Master do the same, and stop threatening.

How do you live out the new identity.

Mutual Submission to christ.

First - Wives and Husbands

Second - Children and Parents

Third - master and slaves.

Assymetry in power.
    - unequal in power.
    - difference in power dynamics.

Paul is not addressing redistribution of power.
- not symetrical.

Why is it important? We currently have a negative authority to power. University
teaches how to invert power. How do you hand power to people that had been marginalized.

It's because of abusive power in the history.
There has been abusive power in the history.

Answer the power is not to just redistribute the power.

It involves greates submission of power. It's actually about the human heart.

There's no perfect power structure. it doesn't matter if you didn't address the heart.

We wantd a different power structure.
He wants us to change the authority structure so we want it to be good.

It's about changing our hearts. this is what ephesians talked about.

You can't translate slaves to bon-servant. It was not always voluntary.

In roman empire, half of hte populaiton are almost in slaved. When roman take power,
they enslave people.

It encompasses a lot of master to slave relationship

Jewish could enslave other jews too. It's a whole range is bigger than our own modern perception of slaves. 

It definitely comes with *abusive type of slaves*

Closest equivalent? THis comes into employment. Voluntary servitude. 

While employed, he/she is your master. Paul talks about a common relationship in the common roman emnpire.

1. Obey your earthly masters.
    - do what you boss says.
        - you do what your boss tells you to do
        - nothing complicated at all, this is very simple, however not easy.
        - actions towards what you do to your boss
        - **you do what he/she says**

    - live out your boss's heart, and make their vision into reality.
    - think about the boss's vision. 
    - you attitude towards boss reflect your attitude towards christ, your true employer.
    - five ways to describe a person's attitude to boss.
        - as service of christ, will of god in the heart, rendering int he service of hte good will.
    - they are all related. if something is repeated five times, it means it's very important!!
    - perhaps the most important thing about how you obey your boss is your **attitude**
    - respect and fear for your boss.
    - sincere heart to christ.
        - that you are authentic and real.
        - bring your authentic self.
    - pastor fred mok is an extreme disagreeable person.
        - he likes to argue.
        - how does he express this criticalness to boss that is glorifying?
            - no way in employee where you argue about everything.

THe idea of picking your battle -- that's how you face your boss in sincerity.

Pastor Frek Mok serves under the elders in his church. Sincerity - pick your battle, and speak to elders
in gentleness of truth and love.

They all go together, and it's not about supressing your personality.

We are usually **conflict avoidant** we don't want to have the hard conversations.

1. seeking harmony is a gift.
1. when you are having meeting. may god manifest courages in your heart.
1. say what you really think when the manager asks. you take the boss seriously, and you tell them what to say.
1. you don't work as if a person watching you. YOu work because *Jesus is present*
    1. you are working for **christ**

You did not want to be the first person that leave work. everyone is just waiting who is the first one that is leaving.
It's because we are watching each other. however **it's not about working for people next to you. it's about working for Jesus**

Doing the will of GOd from the heart.
    - most radical and takes the rest to talk about.
    - we see them in conflict -- working with God and Master.
    - **you need to see taht they are aligned**
        - be enthusiastic.
        - no conditions.
            - you are not serving your boss, you are actually serving the God.

## WHY is this challenging??

Even Pastor Fred MOk said he had fell shorts of it.
- one of his boss, he had the favor. however going through review, extreme anxiety will be felt. Heart beats faster, palm gets sweaty.
- you just feel like you don't do enough
- because pastor mok gave performance metrics for pastor mok. it feels as if the boss is like his dad.
- it can be so difficult for us to have bad attitude, because of the authority in our lives. 
- especially our parents.
- it'll be an obstacle to see our boss as good.
- The assymetrical power are all related.

You have a boss, and a relationship with people.

Treat your slaves the same way.

It can not be obey your slaves.
- there's something different.
- not exactly teh same relationship going both ways

Treat your slaves in the same way.
- give good attitude.
- same attitude of fear and trumbling is given the same way as an empoyer or a boss.

That is radical, because there is no instruction as a boss.

Paul is saying **you don't get to do whatever you want**
- you serve hte *same person*
- our master is in heaven, and it is not us.    

### WE need to stay in our lane.

- stay in our lane. 
- do what our god has commanded us to do.
- live out the commands as God had lived our for all our people.
- you take care of your stuff.

#### Stop using your threats.
- certain industry, you give warning
- stop using threats as regular motivation
- do not motivate them our of fear.
- it does not fit in fear to the other employees.
- it's about doing good for people that does good for you.

#### Story
- had a suspicion that the youth pastor doesnt do right
- turns out he had high expectation to the youth pastor
    - what does it mean to do what is good for him
    - do good will for him
    - also does not know how to do good will for himself.

If you don't see christ as good, kyou will always have suspicions

If you're not obeying yoru boss whole hearteldy , you are not obeying the God.

Once he had a favor, it doesn't matter
- it manifested himself.

if he had servign christ whole-heartedly is to give the guy encouragement.
- he has only thinking about himself.
- the master is not 'villin', it's himself.

**how can i encourage the manager and the friend**

- He recognizes that his attitude was disobedient.
- it's a struggle if hte boss doesn't like him
- it's also a struggle when teh boss likes you
- it's not about winning your bosses's favor. 
- it's about pleasing christ.
- there are two different things, and the chrsit is on our side.

It's the obedience that makes it right. how many plans, wheter it's good or bad -- had failed because of failutre of execution of instructions

Wht matter is the group and tema be united together.

Christian leadreship have a lot of different opionons to the soluitons

obedience is what makes it right.

### Christ

Tlae of three kings. no one knows if you boss is saul or david.

all we know its lord's annoitant. GOd gives saul power, and God gives saul power.

That is the example Jesus had set for us.

He is hte exmaple of Jesus that gives the authentic self

we have an inspiration in the other half.

the point is not to be crushed, but is to be encouraged with the holy spirit to empower us to enjoy waht we do, and enjoy our obedience.

SO we will have the same spirit.

1. invite others to speak to cowokers about boss
    1. important to talk about boss to other coworkers.
    1. invite others to speak the gospel to you about other jobs
    1. responsibilty in the relationship with Christ.

We don't really think God has a reward for us. Not about people pleasing. God's will and our will are aligned together.

Important for pastor fred mok to vent with out poisoning the well. be objective to say to change their attitude.

1. Trust in power of the spirit and teh work pain.

1. borken boss, broken work or both.

- ask teh spirit ot work in you, so you would eexpeirene the mweaning.

We value the freedom so much.

Can we edxperience the meanign of the fellowship of the cross.
