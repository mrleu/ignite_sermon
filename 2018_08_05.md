Humility 
- recognize where we are at to know how to serve.

prayer - for where we are really at.

### Liberating Leadership
we all lead.
  - goes into self leadership.

we all lead, the key is to know what type of leader are you.

leadership always start from home.

- needs to make sense even at home.

you're leading when you're *influencing*

when you're leading, you're creating culture.

what you relate to people 1:1 and amplify to the whole group. that is culture.

it gets amplified even more if you have the leadership quality.

self -> family -> team -> organization -> community.

Usually we tend to be reactive.

Leadership always start from the **inside out**

Jesus called out for congruent leadership inside out.
- there are great leaders in organization, but wrecked at home.

Pastor Abraham is breaking down what kind of leader are you.

Support of challenge Matrix - this is like the radical candor book.

                  Protector # Liberator
Low Challenge <-- ##################### --> High Challenge
                  Abdicator # Dominator
                  
Being the protector brings out a culture of entitlement.
people tend to be skeptical of the leader.
when it explodes, it becomes passive aggressive behavior.

dominator charateristic -- loses valuing of people. bringing culture of fear/dominiation.
- church calls it legalism.

Protector calls it license to sin culture.

America is more of a protector culture.

when you live in the protector culture, how do they feel when they get a healthy challenge.
- they felt easily dominated/hurting.

Abdicator does not care. they just give, and just let it do on its own. No expectation/future.
Bringing into the spiritual things, but it's commonly seen in workplace too.

With Grace and truth emobodied revelation -- Liberator.

The way we live as leaders to balance in both challenge and support.

It's easy to pick one.

Our challenge comes from Phil 2:3-5

True leadership with Jesus is both end.

They key is humble yourself, prefer others.
  - pasotr abraham said it's hard.
  - GOd is giving the Phillipi the challenge.

Phil 2:6-8
- it was taken and given the Jesus himself.
- he was the form of God, yet he took a form of HUMAN.

Jesus himself was wrestling with God the night before.
- but he said *your will be done*.

Jesus still give it all for **us**

Phil 2:9-11

As the Father has given him the challenge, he also had giving him highest support.
- challenge will be given, but God will lift you very very high.
- bring you to the highest of them all.
- You need to empty yourself, and not think about yourself.

Story:

Imagine the kid that has everything -- car, house, choose to work for fun.
- current we are these kids as River of Life.
BOOOM.
- we didn't build this church, and just get the inheritance.
- what do we do if we make no work, and get free inheritance.
- we became a protector culture. we get entitlement.

This is the invitation to grow up.

Actually an invitation to serve and grow up for the Ignite Community.

Currently we are a 100 people, we are going to a size that's an order of magnitude. 
- it's definitely going to feel weird.

Pastor Abe sees a grape cluster in his prayer.
- he wanted it be squeezed. it was this humble position that requires the pressing and suffering of the humble. 
- requires you to serve.
- lots of people holding hands and doing it together.
- there's a call for more of you guys to hold hands and help out.
- as we are crushing the grapes together, we make better wineskin.
- Pastor Abe feels the presence when he worship.
- it feels as big as we hold our hands.

We have to expand incrementally.
We need to create a team of people that does curtains and polls, and grow it as the congregation grows.
Logistic things are *spiritual things*

When got created Temple, there are specific measurement.

When we get to big space, you'd feel naked.

God is saying that we need to have people to serve to grow to add more people.

Challenge to humble yourself -- participate. That invitation is for God to work in your life even more.

Phil 2:12-13
Don't be entitled that you're getting things.
  - spiritual fat.
  - you then get bored.

God is giving the high challenge.

Are you living your life in the calling for the Lord.
For it is God who works in you.

God is calling you to do partnership.

Pastor Abraham trusts us to ask s us for a partership.

If we have entitlement, we will never going to be able to grow up.

We need the challenge and the truth -- practical expression of it.
