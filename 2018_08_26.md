ordination for zone pastor jason!

## Speaker: Pastor Abraham!
- ability to comebine what is in church and secular world together.

- easy to have canned message on the side, as a pastor.
- u get lots of reportorire

- asked what what to preach about.

- as partor abraham prays, ephesian 2:10 came to mind.
- prepared the message in 3 hours. 

- truly packaged for ignite.

- pastor abraham's wife dreamed of the scene in ignite.

- God gave dream to wife, 

God created master piece, so we can walk beforehand.

Jason has been getting perspective from multiple pastors as he was looking for pastors to fill in ignite.

Journey that makes jason into a master piece.

### pastor abraham's story.

- was going to equip a gropu of people to build out a consultation.
- it was a fall out.
- it was devastating, because they all left
- fo r a year, pastor abraham had no church engagement

- original plan was not to speak here, but started from doing leadership training for the ignite youth.

God can make good in the mist of our brokeness.

Ask for the spirit of awareness. 

## Ephesians!

- everything comes from Jesus Christ.
  - given all mercy
  - paul pray for wisdoma nd revelation of GOd not just in the head, but in the heart.
  - may know hwo to give give glory
  - place in this history
  - it's all available. this identity. you would experience it as you pray over it.


- ephesian 2 talked about we were dead.
  - we think we're alive right now, but before Christ we were dead.
  - own works/ability is blinding us.
  - without God, we are dead.
 
tresassors get shoot in Missouri?
- sin leads to death.j
- beofre we had sin -- going to place we had not gone before.

- we used to following and mimicking what society has defined.

- not aligned with Kingdom of GOd.

Unless you have a relationship with GOd, you're being influenced by the world.
  - influence by spirit that is not of God.
  - influence by the demonic power.

Christ gives you the new perspective.

Spirit of intellectual makes it hard to fathom these things.

## Under the influence of the World.
  - Spirit is incentivizing, bringing power that we are in a family that is disobedience to the GOd.

- just following anything we're feeling/thinking(Eph2:3)
This is who we are outside of GOd.

they may all look alive, but dead.

eph 4 tells us how we are *ALIVE*

he pour his mercy to us is so we can show the mmeasurable riche sof his grace in kindness

by God, we are sitting near God.

WHy does God do all of this?

# He wants to showcase to the world how much love and grace he has poured out to the world.

- wants to show the world how much he has puored it in us.

it's not our work. it's god's work that inside of us that is making us alive.

Grace is a free gift. 
Sometimes we need to renew our hearts again.
Same message we share, but we need to be reminded everyday.

It's freeing to know that there's nothign we can or can not do to push/reject God away.

Not in our own doing. TI's the gift of GOd.

so *NO ONE MAY BOAST*

Have nothing to be prideful about.

As God have work for us, Jesus died for us. We have no way to bridget that gap. 
- became taht perfection as we were teh imperfection.
He received the curse and the punishement.

Naturally, we are created to do the same work.

God has to work *for us first*

we have to receive God first, so taht it will overflow into God's good work.

Last week, pastor abe challenge us to serve and engage in responsibility. 
- if we dont' do that, we would be spoiled.

DOnt just be attending, be serving!

THere is a vision of us holding hands teogehter.
  - more peopel holding hands, and it gives us the stability.
  - as we press on the to the grapes.
  - as we say yes to Jesus, we are creating grape wine.
  
It is able to be filled in. 
- it requries all of us to say yes. 

Now as we are saying yes to serve, God has a plan for us. 
- as we say yes tot be uesd as his glory, there are things God has planned we didnt' even know. 
- we will figure it out as we say yes.

Retrospect: Pastor Abe knows thsi is for us.

Kept on saying yes, that leads to him in becoming the zone pastor.

Sees each one of us as a workership.

Beauty of God's image resides in every one of us.

He is actively working through us.

There is a plan to partner.

There is good to express.

Work is given. 
  - it is given before the fall of man kind.
  - God gave work to Adam and eve before they fai. 
    - it's their responsibilty to curate adn steward in partnership with God.

There is a love in partnership.
- not just in the religious sphere. 
- this is even in our *work place*
- God wants to *work with us*

pour out in extravagant love for peopel that don't deserve it.

We need to model out the Jesus Christ.

Bring it to the Coworkers.

It's because we live majority of our time outside of church.

Great work is out there!!

How do we dexipling the nation. 

It's about doing church out there!

SHowing love, and meeting people in their forgiveness.

Do it as if Jesus is your manager. 

This is what we are suppose to do. 

How do you want us to parntering up with you, God.

Some of us thought God could only hapen within **church** not true!!
- some of us compartmentalize 

we are craving for a holistic expression. 

lifestyle missionary.

showcase us not just for the church, but everywhere.

do it whereever we are.

This is what GOd's plan is.

## JOSEPH'S PATHH

story about joseph about his cool coat.
- talks of his boasting about his dream to his dad.

he as prideful, lazy.

Brothers got fed up with it, beating Joseph up. 
- the fool security guard forgot about joseph when joseph gave dreams 
- was forgotten for 2 years.

during the time, joseph was building wisdom, ability, and character formation. managed people, lead pepole.
- he as being mature.
- did he know it? possbily not.

God can work Good in the mist of it all. 

God has given the redeemd body/redeemed mind.
He is making us a masterpiece.

We didnot know we were a solution to it. 

similar to paul; he did not know God had plans for him.

- need to go pray for him bedcause he was blind. 

God use all tehse things to build a beautiful story called redemption.

God has poured so much grace to us. invited us to do good.
- not to earn salvaiton/

we are already beautiful/inheritance.

as you work, you work it together, know that we ar enot eh prisioner of ous own circumstancs.

when we are stuck, it just means we don't know waht GOd is orchestrating rihg tnow.

God is good, and is sitll working/mastery creating for ignite.
