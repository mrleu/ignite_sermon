Genesis 3:7-8
When you put the fig leave on, you make yourself more acceptable, but harder for people to know you.
Harder people know you, harder to know where you are.

### Being Known.

Pastor Mok - give full attention to then GF.
  - say spiritual things for 2 hours in every 24 hours.
  - good to have fig leaf

Needs to keep it up 24/7.

Imagine the crippling anxiety when Pastor Mok is around wife all the time.
  - he used to have a hard time to be around her.
  - He couldn't fully tell her and the wife makes him nervous.

He feels tired in regards to how he needs to behave in front of his wife.

It's crippling. Would not want to be married if he didn't know the truth.

You can craft image of yourself where everything looks good.

There is something cool about curate a certain image that is acceptable by other people.
  - more perfect you are as your fig leaf, the less people know who you are.

That gap is what gives rise in the mental health problem

Such a big gap of schism that people don't know who you are.

What people shared is a bit nakedness.
  - people give those great reasons.
  - takes courage to be honest.

Remedy of the cross.

Romans 5:6-8

24 times sin is used to describe a condition.
  - described as powerless
  - sin is a disease, an affection, a virus.

We are enslaved to it.
To be naked is to be found to be your absolute worst.

Exposure to be found at your absolute worst.

What is the message of the cross. The person who knows you're naked, they have the right to judge you.

He knows everything about you at your absolute worst, and he accepts you fully.

When you are most oppose to God, God saw you and accept you. God will choose the strategic time to love you.

When you come to the cross, we preach the Gospel for non-christian..

When you come to Jesus, you need to come naked.
  - everyone who is covered by the blood comes naked.
  - it's just faith and blood of Jesus

How does it relate to your own life.

Pastor Mok had a nightmare.
  - he was trashed talked. 
  - he felt a sense of inadequency

He gets more anxious when he was being criticized by his wife.
He does not feel accepted.
Live life in fear in shaming. You don't feel accepted. Could you receive the Gospel?

As the result for today, share it with someone. Understand the gospel, can you share it with someone else.
Share it with someone over lunch in regards to where your fig leaves are.
