## Speaker - Pastor Abriaham Jin
Heart for the middle east.
- missionary in Jordan for 2 years.
- his wife had a dream on syria.
- when they were about to go to Syria, got a calling from God to wait. 
- as they wait for 3 months, bombing starts happening. 
- go to go to the south, and stay in Jordan to share the gospel to the refugee. 

Whatever God is doing these missions. Missions in general is going to Middle East/Africa.
There's a *Go* in the battle front, and the *Go* in the places around.

Also a powerful vocation to do so. Because no one else could effect the close sector except for you.

The lord has using technology to amplify to people, but there's also unique access. 
- given us territory of reasons what we're in the silicon vally
- whatever is given, it is given for a reason.

How do we take what we have, and engaged in our *real life*

## Kingdom of God?
Revival & Reformation.

How we can continue to expand the Kindom Of God

More **Expansive** than the 4 walls of church.

There's a king that expands

His Name is Jesus.

He will land on in feet. There will be a Jesus that comes back as a 
1. warrior
1. judge
1. reigning

Kingdom understanding come from the book of Genesis.

Going through the nation that breaks into
1. spiritual life
1. bringing back restoration
1. it will be come to push out oppression and depression
1. spirit of reconciliation of joy
1. bring random people to call each other family(having relationship)

Goes into farming
- frusts as big as head.
Examples of Kingdom Culture.

it is *something that is alive right now*
- actualize when Jesus is back even more.

The taste is given -- physical healing.

Why does God HEAL?
- gives a taste of what it means to get a new body
- when Jesus came back first, he was a JEWISH MAN.
- later he had bodies that could walk through walls.

there is one day when all of our bodies will be restored.

God's spirit >>>>>>>>>>> Demonic Spirit.

One day the demonic spirit will be gone.

We are the **Citizen of Heaven**
- Heaven is coming down to *Earth*

Quoting the Lord's prayer(your kindom come from heaven on earth)

### Heaven is coming down and kissing earth

This is the down deposit of coming down to earth.

There is going to be a time when they will be converged.

When God uses us to dispaly the king's works and powers.

It's like the church => embassy, but church is not a kingdom.

The church is the **People**

People are the God's fuel to take the justice to here.

Revival is a term that bounces around in Christian.
- is it basically **encountering God Through prayers and worship**
- understanding who God is.
- we use the vehicle of prayer/worship to encounter Jesus's presence.

We start to be empowered with our identity when we accept God's lordship.

Thus we can start **Transforming Society**

THis is where we start doing missionary work.

STORY TIME.
- there used to be an initiative for prayer initatiive.
- now revival and reformation is the buzzwords.
- prayer and worship is coming together, but reformation is where the works come to life. 

## The values of this ministry

1. Family
1. Seeking the Presence of GOd
1. Empowering the people
1. Transforming the Society

Seasoning that is ushering in
- ability to empower people and transform society.
- Pastor Jin believes this is  really teh next two tiers the ministry is focused in.

WHAT is the GOSPEL of this KINGDOM?
- scripture time:

Gospel of Jesus christ dying on the Cross. What is the gospel of kingdom of God.

- God wants to have relationship with us. there's work/purpose
- it was great that it was done through his creations.
  - multiply and create dominion
- kingdom of God start to get fractured. authority gets fractured
- someone needs to re-establish the kingdom of God.
- Jesus now becomes the ambassador/true citizen to fully display the heart of hte God(power of Spirit)
- wants to show what the kingdom looks like.
- how kingdom suppose to be demonstrated. JESUS.
- talks about importance of having relationship with God the father.

God does wants to save us, and restore us.
Jesus did the great exchange - he would become sin: personifying sin so that we can be the righteousness of God.

Context that connects to Mark Zuckerburg.
Pastor Abraham said Jesus is better than Mark.

Jesus is going to become us

God gave us a new heart/relationshp/purpose. Jesus also wants to give us a new mission.
- misison of our father, and take dominion and invade all area in life.

There will be a day when Jesus comeback.
- he's going to make everything wrong to right.
- if the key is to raise up the next generation, you are actually doing what Jesus would have done.

When going into media to tell the truth/value that exmplifies the Kingdom of God.
- you're actually the *marketing team for Jesus*

There's a direct correlation to what you do to what God will do when he's coming.

Let us make men in our image.
- the word "image" is repeated many times.

THis means the word image is important.

Out of hte image of himself that we were created to represent the unseen reality in a reasonable way.

Over all the earth and creeps into things of this earth.

This taking dominion in work does not take in dominon over people/women.

It's to take the dominoin of the creation of the land?

How do we reform this life?
- There's nothing new in the sun
- taking what exists right now, and make something new

Pastor Abraham encourages us to **dominate**
- the idea is to dominate. no passiveness to come from.
- much aggressive.

Own image is mentioned twice agian. Whoever God is in revelation reflects how much you know of yourself.

We are defined of our relationship. we are defined by our significant of others/coworkers.

It's because not everyone likes you. 

If you are defined by something that of people, then your relationship goes up and down.

if you are defined by Jesus, there's a calm that comes in when there's a wavering of storm.

You should know who God is, and who we are.

There are some 30 years old that still don't know who they are, because they don't know who God is.

A lot of identity/quarter life crisis, because they don't know who God is.

We seek more reflection of the society than understanding who we are.
- we are just so shaken.

UGhHHH - FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Fruitful/multiply. SEcond time it was repeated. 
- it was all comunicated

Part of being created by God, there is a form of feminity of the persoanlity of God. 
- something that can not be represented through masculinity.

TOtally reminds me of the meagning of marriage. like what kathy had said(tim keller's wife)

Unique stregnth in both genders that can not be substitute for each other.

## IMAGE OF GOD

OPEN QUESTION: DO YOU KNOW YOUR WORTH

IS IT BY THE PEOPLE? OR IS IT BY GOD?

call/response: positive enchancement for self. this is the beginning of the power of influence.

Starts to exemplifies that self acknowledgement of a person's identity.
- needs ot know it in the head, and be able to say it in the *word and the mouth*

Pastor claims you can't be an excellent stewart and multiply to give services.

In PLAIN WORDS: if you suck, you can't be fruitful.

CALLING OUT.
1. don't suck, and just do work for the glorty of God.

Now talks about how you should produce some fruit from God's calling.
You go *fully alive* when you do works for God.
- encourages people to volunteer.

## Not being multiply is actually sinful

call/response to multiply.

Made a bespoke solution. take the influence to lead in the place.

IF YOU HAVE INFLUENCE, you can be a great embassodor.

Product ambassador
- marketing, leverage their names.

## We are God's brand's brand ambassador.

Calling out people's brand sucks.
This is a calling out sermon

We are called to be the best of the ambassaor for Jesus.

Pastor Jin wants to franchse the Gospel.
- calls us to dominate and filling the earth

UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH personal branding/influence/blahh UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Water issues. Can we be engineers to fix issues in the african water issue.
Cheap option to clean stuff.

example of what you could have done with your brand.

calling out the false humanity to die.

calling out our identity of asian males. UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhh

very business driven HMMMMMM generalization hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Encouraging the people here
- people went to berkeley(call out LOL)

Call out the twenties having so much/freedom, and ask what people are doing with it?
are we doing passivity?

Passivity is the greatest <deterrence?> 

If you knew how to leverage/activate, you can literate transform cities. 

need to part of intimacy to impact.
- it's reformational impact. 

Embraces Iris to work in full time job for her kid

Family is living the base foundation of the transformation of the society.

There are 6 categories we bave to be encoutnered for.

APOSTOLLIC GUY - pastor tong.
- going to the ends of the world. 
- korean pastor TONG?

All authority has been given from heaven to earth.

When Jeus comes back, he called us to go and make "disciples of all nations"

Influence in people's lives, you are then discipling them. 

YOu are discipling when you are making decision

Discipling is to batpized them in the name of the HOly spirit
- teaching them to observe for all things that have been observed.

When you teach and encourage them to forgive; walking through the process and discuss how you are able to forgive others first.
- Non-believe can see the principle of the relation.
- they start to listen

There is the whole prayer and releass of restoration - grace

WHen people first preached the Gospel, they didn't even know who true Jesus is

DISCPLESHIP is when you have influence over other people.

Accountability for christmas time. 

we need to be accountable. 

Each sphere.

1. Family is the beginning place: where beginning starts to happen.
1. Education - 
1. Government
1. Business
1. Church

Looking at the religious spehere -- as it is rising and have revival
 have enoucnter with God, and his presence gives us covering. 
 
 gives us covering of God, and covering of Men.
 
 Ability to hungry to expansion of Kingdom.
 
 TO have it in our work.
 Is it better than bringing in restoriation
