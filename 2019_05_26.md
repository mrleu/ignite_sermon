Leadership Structure
- different people means seeing different people part of the team.
- it's always changing

## Sermon - Jason Wang
- it's going to hurt, because Jason Wang's voice is raspy.

Marvel Cinematic Universe
22 movies
They are all connected from one to another.

### Jason Cinematic Universe(LOL)

He likes to repeat his previous sermons.

1. Parable of the Talents
    - passing stuff we know to other people
    - leadership philosophy
    - he talks a lot about the church.
    - shares a lot of personal stories, but on stage he is more vulnerable.
    - wants people to understand him and know him
    - doesn't hold anything back.
    - it may look like he had everything together, but he is just like everyone else.
    - hopefully people can adapt as well

2. Temptation of Christ
    - first thing that happens to him is to see if he is qualified to do things.

3. Parable of the prodical son
    - a lot of us become the older son, and not the younger people

4. Laborers of the Vineyard
    - doesn't make sense if you make things in terms of being fair 
    - god is fair and just, we just odn't understand it.

5. Submitting to authority
    - countercultural to what we were taught
    - spiritual principal

6. Submit to God's timing
    - we have to wait

7. Timing reveals character
    - True character of God

IT's so you don't have to spend 10 years to get there. The last thing to conclude is what is pastor jason's Purpose.

What he wants to address today. Pastor Steve travelled around the world, that they are either looking for security and significance. It's his first time in santa clara, yet pastor jason wants to know as well.

Two scripture to emphasizes it: Mathew 3 16-17.
THis affirms how we all need security -- secure in our identity. that people cared about us. Church is good at taking care of people. THere's small groups and luncheon.

Mathew 4:18-20
Jesus said he can make peter fisherman of men. higher calling, higher purpose. THat's when they see the kingdom of heaven come. He said follow him first. 

It's human nature. we want to know that our lives matter. that we all make a difference. no matter what, zpj wants to know that his life matters. If you don't feel like your life does that, you get restless. We were designed to have a purpose and a destiny.

He wants to share how do you find your purpose. It's going through ZPJ's personal experience.

First thing to find purpose is to 

## Who are your people?

Finding destiny means finding your people. introverts are all called into identity. We all *need* people
THere are work, cultural, ethnic community, but we all know our community

ZPJ never asked himself that question -- he just goes to church and goes to work.
Who did God assign himself to be apart of.

Another questiont to ask is:

## Where can you serve?
Great among you must be your servant
Being Great == being significant.
Deep down, we all want to be great.
Son of God came to be served. He gave his life for the ransom of many.
You don't get ransom money back. WHen we give, we expeected something -- but we usually don't expect anything back.
When you are serving, you are not really expect something back?

## Where are you needed?
He wants to be a necessity, not luxury
You were born an original, don't be a copy.
Something you were uniquely made to do.

## Where do you produce fruit?
Funny analogy
    - pursue a relatonship. other people will give you clues to give your further. don't go when there's no clues.
    - watches a lot of youtube videos.

He is gong to go through how he answered these questions

Two questions he always asked:
    1. is he good
    1. what is is purpose

he likes to ask his mom is he good, and what is his purpose.

Good comes into security. Youth gives you a lot of praise. Starts to question if he is realy good. He never tries to make his goodness comes form  himself. He sort of shared about it from the temptation of christ.

What is his purpose.

Who are you people?

He used to do half of the offering. He feels lonely that if he is the only working people. He went to other churches. He felt like a guest at other people's church. He feels like it's messy at home. It's not so nice. It felt like home, the fact that it's messy.

It's easy to win with people. if you are going to lose, who are you going to lose with people.

He is ok with losing playing basketball with ignite. That's when he realized maybe he loves this group.

Even if people are different grous, he sees it as part of the group. he really showed his heart.

Where can he serve?

he serves wherever he needed.
He used to serve at annoucement.

It's always know there's an older person there that is covering you. That's what GOd made him to be. God now wants him to be more of a father.

Where are you needed?

He sees fruit when he is here. do things here in ignite that it's hard to do.
Where do you do at ignite.

Purpose in life and purpose at work.
