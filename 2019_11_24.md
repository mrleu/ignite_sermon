### ZPJ
- life group church.
- name change. changed this week.
- made the change to be more intuitive on what the group is for.

life comes out of these groups.
- hard to meet people at church, but at lg you're able to.
- living in fellowship, everyday.
- Hebrews 10:24-25
- even god is doing 3 in 1 in community.

## Spritual Blindness
How god moves in ways that we don't expect.
- can't talk about it with out talking about spiritual aspect.

ZPJ may not be an expert, but it is something that zpj wants to share about it.

Bible is also not super clear on how everything works. it's not going to be a manual. Seminary actually doesn't really teach you that much. it's much more of a academic study of the bible.

Ephesians 6:11-12

there's devil, and he has schemes. greatest lie is to convince the world that he doesn't exists.
the western world we continue to move beyond that, thinking that it's not real.
we choose to compartmentalize spiritual stuff, and then just go over to the day to day.

be more aware, and believe in God, and knows devils are doing stuff in schemes.

also reminded zpj that spiritual warfare is not againts flesh and blood
    - get caught up fighting people.

mannerism in traffic may also happen.

our battle is not against flesh and blood. dark forces in the world that has control over the world. it does exist and we can't just pretend that it doesn't exist.

help make people to think to not gloss over that it doesn't exist.

pretty forth the forarm of god.

zpj is a practical guy
    - reminded him that what applicable things that impact the spiritual realm.
    - what can he do to impact the spiritual realm

same body part of prayers.

mouths have a lot of impaccts.

proverbs 18:21

spiritual power about what you say. it can bring life or death. does have impact on physical realm. has physical impact on what actual happens.

you pray --> something physical happens.

if you speak death, you eat its fruits. live day to day

luke 6:45.
if they speak evil things, the stuff is their heart is probably not too well. God gives us two ears and 1 mouth
- more time listening than speaking.

once you get used to talking, you gotta give yourself sometime to listen.

important what we say.

spiritual blindness - zpj starts to forget what he says is important. he feels like he needs to be aware of what he's saying.

how important are words?

we tend to have some words spoken over us.
stuff we were told when we were kids also affected us too.

it made zpj realizes that what people said to him 20 years ago still impacted him.

### Example
ZPJ doesn't sing. whenever worship asks him to sing, he doesn't sing. when you sing for the lord, you didn't care. someone then told him that he sucks at singing. that person got good at singing.

mom would always tell zpj that he's a good boy. he always remember that his mom thinks that he's a good boy. give _conviction to keep moving forward_.

over-seeing has a death to it.

what people say does carry further in  your life

what aspect do you speak into?

### how we speak to God
- worshp and prayer
something very powerful when people come together and sing/worship together.
something that really changes the spritual atmosphere.
spiritual posture for humility.
raising hand is a act of surrendering. he reminds himself to surrender him to God.
different than thinking in your heart.

pray outloud is different. he falls asleep when he prays inside. pray out loud is the act of submittion
Actually putting out actions.

he asked for lord's help a lot. the posture should be asking what he wants God to do.

how do we speak to ourselves. due to outbringing, we look at ourselves in negative light.

easier to say something negative about ourselves.

psalms 149

David know that he is fearfuly and wonderfully made.

ZPJ feels short, but never bothered him. he never talked about he's too short.

if ZPJ is taller, he might be too proud. God made him a particular way. feafully and wonderfully made.
iron sharpens iron.

good to have someone you trust to give you feedback.
### how we speak to ourslves
ZPJ got feedback, so he doesn't misuse your words. wanting mor eof God, more reference to bible.
we do all these things because we want more of God.

put God first in everything that we do.

feedback you either get sad or get mad.

EPhesians 5:4

holy spirit convicted pj that he joked too much.

when ZPJ was at high school. he said a lot of bad jokes. holy sp

zpj is proud of us!

he believes we are really good people. ignite you can find genuinly good people

### how we speak to other people
