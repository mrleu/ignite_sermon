# Speaker - ZPJ(Zone Pastor Jason)
- he introduced himself(LOLL)
- thinking of a theme for ignite.
- rolcc theme is expand and upgrade.
    - really resonated with ZPJ.
    - funny, since it never resonated with ZPJ before.
- think it really applies to ignite.
- Breakthrough is when you open something/access to something that you couldn't do before. It's like removing a large rock that was stuck infront of your role.
- what constraint the chinese congregation is that they don't have enough space.

What is ignite break through? This occurs to Jason that ignite also has shikinah glory breakthrough.

1. Being able to move into immanual. Space constrating is no longer there. We now have a huge space, don't even need to go to the lobby anymore.
1. Pastoral position filled.

Now that we have breakthrouhg. They have been cleared. It now opens up to new season of expands and upgrade. 

## Expand
    - most practical way is to have more people. ZPJ thinks we will see more people to come to ignite. THis comes with faith. It will lead to more ministry and more leaders. 

Data - last year average attendence is 65. This year, the 6 services was 92. It's 42% increase. Can't imagine how many people at the end of the year we'd have. Vision Casting from Pastor Cheng - he said this room would be filled. PC said it could filled twice more(200 people.) It's by faith that ZPJ belives it will happen right here. This is the physical expansion.

##  Upgrade
    - Being able to do more stuff. 
    - if we want to physical steward, we need to physical upgrade outselves to grow spiritually.
    - ZPJ resonated with how Pastor Tong's claim that he doesn't know how to get the upgade.
        - keep stepping forward, and od will reveal himself.
    - This is how that ZPJ has thought about at this point.

Parable of the Prodigal Son. OH man! is this the one where ZPJ will run to a new person?!

**Luke 15:11-32**

Three main characters in the parable -- father, older son, and younger son.

### Younger son
    - he wants his inheritance early. He wanted the share before the death of his father. Not only did he take the money early, and then spend it recklessly. Prodigal means to be wastefully extravagant.
    - he then becomes a hired man and longs for pig food to survive. He traded all away to be a servant for someone else.
    - ZPJ: "How the mighty have fallen" (LOL)
    - realizes how he sinned against heaven and before his father.
    - you're not really sinning against yourself, you're sinning against God.
    - most of us can relate to the prodigal son.

### The Father
    - he actually grants his son's request and give him the inheritance early.
    - hard to imagine an old man grow compassion and run to a young person.
    - when you visualize it, an older man come in to hug someone and kiss someone.
    - ZPJ thinks it's cringing when an old person runs to a young person.
    - younger son actually has prepred remarks. The father already cut him off, and asked to give him the best robe.
        - the father is so excited, that he didn't let the son finishes his remark.
    - It's fitting to know that a son was dead, but now alive.
    - appropriate response is to be happy.

When people were spiritually dead, but suddenly alive again. The appropriate response is to be happy to see them -- to celebrate.

The story represents God.

### The Older Son
    - he heard the commotion.
    - it didn't say the older son isn't happy that his younger brother came back, however he was not happy with his father's celebration of the younger brother return.
    - had a very merit/work based mentally. He's basically a party pooper.
    - another thing is that he did not see his brother as a younger brother. he said "this son of yours came back."

Older son sees it as a worker-to-son relationship. The father had always had relationship with his son. Nothing is changed with the inheritance. Then the brother got something that the he didn't think the brother deserved.

Story revealed that the older son didn't see it as a father-to-son relationship.

#### Context to when Jesus told the story

Older son is referencing the pharisees. Even though the pharisees know the bible really well, they don't really know the heart of God at all. You might know someone else that knows God really well, but you don't feel God as you talk to them. Jesus says they look holy on the outside, but they're not really holy. Pharisees probably got tired of them given the fact that Jesus had been giving *shades* to the pharisees for 3 years.

Pharisees actually accusesd Jesus for eating with the sinner. Father is referencing God -- how God longs for the children to return to him. God sees both brothers son. His love for the son is not through performance, but through willingness to return to God.

ZPJ alwasys thought of himself as the prodigal son. He used to always think of the prodigal son as a fictional character. Peple don't really relate themselves as the bad guy.

how does it relate to Ignite?

### Testimony Time.

2010-2014 age ZPJ went through emo stage. He always looked angry, because he always was. He never talked to anybody. Reading the prodgial son seems like a progression of a christian walk.

There was a vibrant passion of youth community when ZPJ first went to church. The paradigm hits him. He didn't know there were so many chinese people. He used to get Ds in middle school, so he enjoyed church that no one judged him by his poor grade.

He used to had an older son mentality.
1. he used to work with church. Someone got hired as assistant when they just came to church. they used to co-lead cell group. At the end he made up with the assistant person later.
1. another thing is that he had nothing in common with the pastor. THey also made up later too.

ZPJ used to get little irked when he sees them. The more he heard how good they were, zpj gets irked. He then took a break, and God gave him this message.

Father stage is happening from 2015 to the present. 

He needed to love them both. Moral of the story is to be the father of the story. After talking with the assistant, the assistant told him that she used to think ZPJ hated her.

Becoming chariman is when ZPJ realizes how hard it was. In 2015, ZPJ apologizes to the pastor how hard it was to run a ministry. Aspired to be the father of the story. If we don't, we will become the older son. If we don't upgrade ourselves spiritually, we would become the older son. New comer are going to be the younger son. If we don't have the father'sheart, we could get *judgemental*.

Even the new people, coming in a bit would still be the old people. Then the older people would be even older.

Response - praise for the congregation to have the father's heart. To spiritually upgrade oureselves into the next level.
