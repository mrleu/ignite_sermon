## Unity

Harmony Relationship
- it's important keep.

Secret for happy marriage - JOKE
- 10 reasons to forgive her husband.
    - what are those 10 reasons? all the 10 reasons are blanks.
    - there are no reasons to forgive?(alex speculation)

Psalms 133 - peace and harmonious life.
- tiny words right after 133:3.
- background behind the psalms
- song about essence.
    - 120-134 they are called pslams of essence
    - when they pay homage to jerusalem
    - they will come to jerusalm like a pilgrilmage to Mt Zion, sing psalms.

They begin to sing these songs at the mt. zion.
This song is written by david.
David was moved to write this songs after so many conflicts, and after the conflicts the isarel finally come together.
so they finally live together to live in harmony. He was then moved to write songs about unity.

It described the blessing to have unity. Lord bestowed this blessing even more.

Abraham is the source of all blessing. We need to live in all unity to bring the blessing among us.
- only when we have unity and harmony, we can have blessing.
- only together we can live among christ.
- love to bless those who live in unity.

_What is unity?_

It's not uniformity - wear the same uniform.
    - this is outward appearence

Unity is something that comes from inside.
    - people send vision/belief
    - goals in life.
    - so we come together, put out our differences to pursue the same dream

Come togehter because we share the same vision.
    - important for us to bind together.
    - god loves unity. WHy? because God himself is the trinity.
    - that's why Jesus is outward concern.
        - his concern is not about how much faith/love they have.
            - it's about unity.

### __Unity is at the heart of Jesus__

John 17:22-23 - great high priest prayer.

because of unity, it's so important to god to share the glory to all of the disciples.

because of God's glory, that we share the glory. Therefore we can be one.

I in them and you in me. In order for all of us to be in christ, we need to have the christ to be in us.

With out christ in us, we can be very selfish, self centered. When we follow christ, jesus christ live within us.

We can then have this complete unity.
    - it's not about me, i, and myself.

This is the mark of our identity, so that the world know that you sent me and love.

Experience from Christ is within us, we learn to let go of our own opinions. We can let go of the things that we hold on to.
    - we think about what is best for the group

### Second blessing - Unity brings annointing

Type of annointing is supernatural ability for us to do what God wants us to do.

It's something that we can't do within our own talent. God give us the power to forgive, accept one another.

Psalms 133:2 - annointing oil
    - before aaron was set aside to be the high priest, he needs to be annointed.
    - special made of oil that is consist of flavored fragrance.
    - before aaron can become a priest, they need to pour the oil on his head.
        - down upon his head into robe
        - aaron's blessing goes arond him so he can flow to people around him.

Power to serve.

Exodus 30:30-1
- God is consecrating him, making him apart so he can be holy.
- very importantt to realize
- put our differences aside, to meet in congregations
    - God is going to set us apart, and use us as the vessels.
- So god can annoint us and use the dew to annoint us.

When you don't have the power to serve, it's good to ask if you are having harmonious relationships with wife/work/brothers/sisters/relationships.

Dew of harmon from mt. zion.
- God's blessing will flow to us, so we can be a channel of God's blessing.
- Mt. Hermon is the highest mountain in northern bounds of isarel.
    - 4 times higher than mission peak.

Snow capped on the mountain.
Every year when the climate changes, it creates mounntain dew

mount zion dew is very rich and fruitful.
    - what does it mean?
    - when we live in unity, we not only have aaron's blessing. we will also become blessing of people that is around us.

We receive God's blessing. it's what unity do to us. It's what blessing do to us.
